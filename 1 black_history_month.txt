Against Black History Month 

In 1925, a history professor named Carter G. Woodson first proposed what we now call Black History Month. It would profit America, Woodson wrote, to overturn a pedagogical tradition in which black Americans were customarily “overlooked, ignored, and even suppressed by the writers of history textbooks and the teachers who use them.” The son of a former slave, Woodson looked around at his partially reconstructed country and did not like what he saw. An entire class of people had simply been written out of America’s story on account of the color of their skin. If America wanted to see its house undivided, something had to be done.

The first of those somethings, then named “Negro History Week” and hosted in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, was held in 1926, during a period when government-sanctioned segregation was the norm in many states; when “separate but equal” was not just an abstract legal theory but was practically attempted — with more focus on the “separate” bit than the “equal”; when the military was segregated; when the practice of lynching had not yet died out in the South; and when many states flatly prohibited mixed-race marriages. The stain of Plessy v. Ferguson still sat glaringly on the American escutcheon, mocking the famous words of the Declaration.

Things, mercifully, have changed. Education should follow suit. Rather than being treated as a separate and limited discipline, divorced by the pigmentation of its subjects from “mainstream” American history, the teaching of black history should hew to the principle of integration. Black Americans are not visitors putting on a cultural show, nor are they legally separated. They are an integral, inextricable part of the country’s past, present, and future. The curriculum should treat them as such.  

Instead, the practice of academic separation has been expanded. In 1976, Congress changed “Negro History Week” to “Black History Month,” with President Gerald Ford leading the effort to recognize it federally and taking it upon himself to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.” A few years back, in 2005, Morgan Freeman perfectly set out the obvious case against this trend, telling 60 Minutes’s Mike Wallace that Black History Month was “ridiculous.” “Why?” asked a surprised Wallace. “You’re going to relegate my history to a month?” asked Freeman, visibly annoyed. “Which month is Jewish History Month?” Wallace conceded that there wasn’t one. “Do you want one?” Freeman pressed. “No, no.” Well, Freeman concluded, “I don’t want a Black History Month” either. “Black history is American history.”  

As to why, as people sometimes ask, there is no “White History Month,” the answer is obvious: White Americans were not systematically denied citizenship. They were not (generally) owned as property. There were no “white codes” contrived to push them outside the Constitution’s protection. They were the majority, and they held all the power. History lessons, as Professor Woodson observed, rarely underrepresented whites. Whatever indignities European immigrants suffered on the free side of Ellis Island, they did not make a white Woodson necessary.

The question here is not so much whether blacks have disproportionately suffered historically — they have — or whether we still feel the legacy of that — we do — as it is whether the correct response to that suffering is to segregate black history into a separate branch of the curriculum or a single month on the school-year calendar. On most indicators — income, employment, education, incarceration, homeownership, etc. — black Americans still do worse than white Americans. But the notion that Black History Month must remain in force because there are still racial problems in America is a non sequitur. If there is still too little “black history” taught in America’s schools — or if “black history” is being taught incorrectly — then we should change the curriculum. If black Americans remain unfairly in the shadows, then the solution is to bring them out, not to sort and concentrate them by color.

Sure, Black History Month’s defenders say, but what’s the problem? After all, there’s also this month and that month. Currently, we have Women’s History Month, South Asian Heritage Month, Haitian Heritage Month, Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month, Jewish American Heritage Month, Caribbean-American Heritage Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National American Indian Heritage Month, and Alaska Native Heritage Month. There’s even a Confederate History Month. But a profusion of multi-culti months doesn’t improve things any more than a profusion of wrongs make a right. In a country that is supposed to be a melting pot, are we truly supposed to take comfort in having our complex history cut up into little slices and distributed with varying emphasis to students throughout the year?  

I grew up in a mixed-race household. My cousin, who is half-Malawian, lived with us a lot of the time. Some of the time my aunt did, too. My aunt had black skin; I have white skin; my cousin’s is somewhere in between. And, really, it is the least interesting thing about us — an utterly, totally, thoroughly boring detail that made no difference to anything.  

That is, until my cousin went to school. Come the first of October (Britain’s Black History Month is later in the year), my cousin wasn’t my cousin any more. She was my black cousin. At eight years old, she was cast by her teachers as an expert on Malawi — which she left before she could walk — and, it seemed, as a general spokeswoman for all black British people in the Cambridge area. And for a few classes per year, the Kumbaya ecumenism of the British state school system was set to one side while the eyes of her fellow pupils were trained upon her skin. In the course of the month’s lessons, my cousin, who was born in 1990, was held up as an emblem of the suffering of people she never knew and will never fully understand. It was absurd.

Equally absurd is the repetitious focus on a few — unquestionably admirable — characters, such as Martin Luther King, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and Frederick Douglass. Even if we agree to the conceit that focusing on leaders is the best way to teach history, would they honestly fail to make the cut if Black History Month were absorbed into the schedule? To answer “yes” is to suggest that a school curriculum, if integrated, would ignore these leaders and the pivotal moments when they rose to prominence: the Civil War and the civil rights movement. This strikes me as unlikely. And herein lies the point: Things have changed. Carter Woodson “never viewed black history as a one-week affair,” the Association for the Study of African American Life and History told the Philly Post’s Michael Coard. “He pressed for schools to use Negro History Week to demonstrate what students learned all year. It was in this sense that blacks would learn of their past on a daily basis that he looked forward to the time when an annual celebration would no longer be necessary.” Eighty-seven years later, we have reached that point. Black history is no longer “overlooked, ignored, and even suppressed.” It shouldn’t be separated, either.

==================================

It's one month of history that is repeated ad nauseam throughout people's entire public school life. That one month of paying teachers across America costs billions of dollars. How many more times would you like this brief African US history to be repeatedly taught? We only need to teach it once. We don't need to learn about the same MLK speech and African part of the slave trade every year for an entire month. It is vastly wasteful.

This is largely why the US is radically falling behind all other developed countries in education. One month may not seem like a lot, but you multiply it by the number of years a child/teen is in school and it adds up to be a lot of time that should have been used on actually teaching useful knowledge..

==================================

black people diserve there own month because of selfish white decided to take poor black people to there country and treat them as garbage and trash so i belive that black people earned that month and should keep it

==================================

    Whites were also slaves in the US, so were Asians. Should we teach about that for an entire month, every year... wasting billions of tax payer dollars? Those teachers aren't free you know.
==================================

These days, I think it's more important to celebrate the big names in western civilization - before public education and college curriculum have blasted them from the annals of history..

==================================

Black History Month is yet another contrived attempt at separating blacks from society in general and perpetuating the myth that blacks still suffer in some major way from discrimination. My experience is that we have finally crawled out of that media-spawned mode that feeds into the myth by continually "stirring the pot."

As for the comment about why there is no "White History Month," I must remind that the Irish and Italians, to name two groups, suffered from discrimination in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, yet I see no national Irish History Month or Italian History Month.

I tire of some (not all) blacks consistently basing their opinions and their outlooks that still paint far too many of their white counterparts in the same light as whites of the past. I have yet to see a black comedian go on stage and present a comedy routine that is NOT based on race. They are able to make negative racial jabs at whites in their audiences, expecting them to sit there and be happy at obvious insults, masked as comedy. If a white person tried this stunt with a black audience, he could expect a very short lifespan.

Black History Month is another reminder that negatively implies that today's whites should be ashamed of the transgressions of their ancestors who lived in America, even though our ancestors might not have emigrated to the United States until long after slavery was practiced. Enough is enough!

==================================

Watched the Superbowl. 80% of the players were blacks. All the featured entertainers were blacks. Dozens of millionaires. Yet this is still a racist country where blacks simply cannot succeed.

==================================

Few things offend against justice and damage the common good more than our omnipresent hard government sanctioned institutionalized racial discrimination against white people in general, and white men in particular. The time has long past when this might have ever been considered justified. The overwhelming opportunity offered to all blacks, regardless of the content of their character, has made them a ruling class. They are over represented everywhere by the racial spoils system. This cannot, and will not, last. And the same simmering anger, hatred and bitterness that grew up among blacks against whites is now growing up in whites against blacks. Furthermore, whites are not a small, old and dying group: whites are almost 70% of the population today and will still be the greatest single group beyond 2050 when they will still be 50% while the second largest group, Hispanics, will be only 30%. If I were black, I would bear in mind how hard it is to reverse racial antagonism and I would be trying to make peace with 7 out of 10 people in this country instead of trying to demoralize them as Obamba does at every turn. I would remember that the lessons of history: a small minority cannot rule over a vast majority for ever, and the more they oppress them the worse will be the result for them when they lose power, as they always do.

==================================

I'm sick to death of 'Black' everything..

I'm tired of hearing about slavery and integration.. I no longer care.

Sorry... It's nothing but a dry well at this point.

==================================

They are an integral, inextricable part of the country’s past, present, and future.
Then there will more crime, more welfare, more extrem lieftists presidents and more Detroits.

==================================

I agree, there should not be a Black History Month...and in my school, they have done away with it completely. But then again, we homeschool.

==================================

Martin Luther King is "unquestionably admirable?" Please, Mr. Cooke. Is plagiarism unquestionably admirable? Is serial adultery unquestionably admirable? Is allying oneself with Ho Chi Minh unquestionably admirable?

==================================

    What we should celebrate is Allen West, a brave, smart man; we should've had more people like him in the South, that we way we could have preserved our way of life and saved ourselves from the war of northern agression.
==================================

when the practice of lynching had not yet died out in the South

It took it quite some time to die out in Howard Beach. What part of the South is that in again?

==================================

    Nobody was lynched at Howard Beach. What are you talking about?
==================================

        Are you one of those Eisensteins who thinks that lynching is only hanging? Or, more fitting for a Stalinist, that it only happens in the South? Now, run along and The Google "Howard Beach baseball bat" and see what you come up with.
==================================

            Are you one of those Einsteins who think that lynching is something that only happens to black people by white people? What about what happened to Michael Carter, Dustin Kaiser and their friend, a fourteen year old girl who didn't want her name released, who accidentally ended up in a black neighborhood on July 21, 1997 where they were surrounded by a gang of black youths who killed Carter, beat Kaiser and shot him in the head, then forced the girl to perform oral s*x on all of them before they shot her in the face. The victims were white and were taunted for it. Was this a 'hate' crime? Were these young people lynched? What about the murders of whites committed by the cult of Yahweh Ben Yahweh? http://yah.whgbetc.com/ I guess since the victims were white and the perpetrators black racists this gains no currency for you? In the Fall of 1998 a German tourist in Santa Monica, CA was shot by two black men and one black woman in front of his wife and kids for not being able to speak English well enough. What about what happened to Reginald Denny, or all of the Asian store owners whose shops were destroyed by blacks rioting in Los Angelas? How does all of the race baiting and grievance politics of the left help this situation out? If you don't like racism, don't be a racist, no matter who you are.
==================================

                Wow, rocky. Was that misdirected or what, I mean especially since you are calling me a Soviet propagandist, even though I obviously know what "extrajudicial execution carried out by a mob" actually is.
==================================

I heard that there is a Senator from Massachusets who wants to make Sitting Bull's birthday a national holiday. High Cheekbones Day.
==================================

120+ mostly ignorant, mostly racist comments to a well written, nuanced piece. Lovely.

This very comment thread is Exhibit A in why black history month is still necessary. Because just maybe there's hope for the next generation.

The one commenting here is already screwed.

==================================

    Please cite specific examples of racist comments in this thread. Your answer will doubtless prove illuminating.
==================================

    Schools aren't supposed to be indoctrinating kids with your political agenda.

    They're supposed to be teaching kids facts and knowledge aimed at getting them to be employable, productive workers or college students, not propaganda aimed at getting them to vote Democrat and have a particular partisan view of America.
==================================

Who still believes in that whole "melting pot" thing? Italian Americans want to celebrate their Italian American-ness. Jewish Americans want to celebrate their Jewish American-ness. I like going to the annual Highland Games and partying with the Scottish Americans even though I'm not Scottish American. Black History Month is just another celebration by an ethnic group (albeit exceptionally well marketed and popular) and you can participate or not. If you don't like bagpipe music, don't go to the highland games.

==================================

    If you attend a public school, you can't "participate or not." You have to participate. It's not "exceptionally well marketed and popular" -- it's mandatory.
==================================

    You appear to badly misunderstand the concept of the melting pot. It does not mean people give up their cultural heritage. It has never meant that. It means we accept useful cultural standards, such as speaking a common language, and we all give up allegiances to cultural values incompatible with American values.
    So, for instance, Americans have no problem at all with Muslims praying five times a day in the direction of Mecca. Whatever floats their boat. We do have a problem with them trying to cram sharia law down our throats.
==================================

        The melting pot standard is about sharing - the opposite of competing.

        St Patrick's Day is a day when everyone can be "Irish For a Day".

        Kwanzaa is not a holiday when everyone can be black for a day or week. The idea would be considered offensive, if anyone were stupid enough to seriously propose such a thing..

        Even groups that have good reason for defining and maintaining clear boundaries - such as religious groups (which by definition must distinguish between who belongs and who does not) take it as a compliment, not an insult, if you borrow their culture, as long as you do so respectfully (that is, if you borrow their holiday to celebrate it, rather than changing and destroying it). You can eat all the bagels you want and nobody is ever going to get in your face about stealing the culture or keeping the Jewish man down.

        There comes a point where you have to simply dive in and take the risk. America has done everything it can think of to acknowledge the wrongs of the past, make things right, and show its good faith - the lack of acknowledgement of that fact is starting to cause its very own brand of racial tension.
==================================

            I've never tried to celebrate Kwanzaa (still not really sure what it is), but I have a feeling if a bunch of white people started celebrating it like St. Patrick's Day very few in the black community would be offended. Of course, for one to celebrate another culture's special day, it really does help if alcohol is involved, and a cool wearin' of the green tradition to get the kiddos involved too.
==================================

Exactly. But try stopping Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. They are the biggest instigators. It is their bread and butter. What is going to happen to them when people of all colors finally live in peace and harmony. And I do resent the Civil Right Movement. The name should be changed to reflect only the black community because they sure don't represent any other minorities but blacks.
==================================

    How can you resent something you obviously no nothing about. Maybe you should read about Dr.King and all his foot soldiers (Harry Belafonte) and so many other's before you make a judgment about it only being for blacks. Mahatma Gandhi, Poor People's March on Washington, "I Have a Dream "speech etc. The above will show that the movement was about blacks getting the rights we deserved but also about other's rights as well.
==================================

        Does it bother you that Gandhi wrote letters to Hitler addressing him as, "My Dear Friend?" MLK wanted everyone to respect everyone. Gandhi hated the British as vehemently as anyone hates. MLK was not about hate. Yes, I've read what he wrote. Do you think that he'd be happy about all of the black dependence on govt. handouts and the poor educational outcome that many blacks have now, which is worse than ever? How do you think Dr. King would feel about the 70% out of wedlock births among black children? The rate was 26% when Dr. King died. How do you think Dr. King would feel about the way that Herman Cain was treated by the liberal media? How do you think Dr. King would feel about the way liberal whites have called Justice Clarence Thomas, a man who has earned everything he has, an Uncle Tom black? How about those racist ads produced by the democrat white opponent of Senator Allen West? This is a travesty, but keep letting those democrats tell you that they care about you while they keep so many in the black community dependent and under their control.
==================================

My great-great-grandmother immigrated to the united states from South Africa. Her parents were British, and white as white can be. But, I am 1/16th African American, right? At this point, what difference does it make?
==================================

    On another board a college student, a white immigrant from South Africa, was relating the troubles he's gotten into for checking off African-American when presented with forms. It really stymied the administrators and he was punished each time.
==================================

    The manager of the plant I'm laid off from is African-American. He's a white man from Durban who was naturalized about a year and a half ago.
==================================

Conservatives are always trying to take things away from the Blacks, Hispanics and the poor. No wonder you lose elections.

==================================

    What, specifically, are they trying to take away?
==================================

    Yes, MLK was against racial hustlers and those who want handouts for minorities. In fact he was against so-called "civil rights" and other forms of oppression against Real Americans.
==================================

    MLK was a conservative Republican. If your think that your statement is true offer some facts to prove it.
==================================

        If he were alive today, do you actually think MLK would side with the GOP/Tea Party?

        Surely you aren't that naive.
==================================

            Do you think that Dr. King would support the greater than 70% out of wedlock births in the black community? How about the disproportionately high drop out rates among black students? This isn't a racial issue unless you acknowledge that it's the democrat's policies of welfare dependance and support for teacher's unions over quality education that have lead to this destruction in our society. What policies of president's do you support? Which of his policies made you want to vote for him? Which of his policies do you think Dr. King would have supported?
==================================

            Yes, because he wanted a colorblind America, free of government intrusion. He would be marching with Sarah Palin and Paul Ryan for freedom-based, common-sense small-town conservative solutions and for the liberation of other countries, like Iran. The other "historical" figures like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass were just thieves and agitators against our sacred property rights.
==================================

Tell me, how does stuffing the February television schedule with one black sitcom after another set history right?

Weren't most American blacks prior to the Emancipation Proclamation slaves? If that's so, they likely didn't have much impact on history. So, let's contrive a history to make up for it. Oh, there were many Antebellum blacks who weren't slaves, you say. One certainly wouldn't know that from today's histories and news. They all descend from slaves, even those fresh from Africa. They're still slaves and deserve more than mere reparations; they deserve all that whites have. I mean all of it should be redistributed to blacks, leaving whites destitute and reduced to slaves to the nation's racial minorities. Sounds fair, don't it?

I'm sick of the mention of anything to do with race and racial differences. Look, I'll make a personal deal. You stop talking race and I will, too. You stop being offended and I will, too. You stop expecting special treatment and I..., oh, wait, I don't get special treatment. Well, you stop expecting it, anyway, and I won't have anything to complain about.

Ya' see, my family came here from Europe in the mid-nineteenth century. None of them ever held slaves. Some were, in fact, abolitionists and most were dirt farmers. They never had much and worked very hard for what they got. They belonged to a despised minority religious group and some suffered severe persecution. No history month for them. No reparations for them and none for me. It didn't happen to me; it happened to them. That's done and gone. Those
of us who belong to that once despised and persecuted minority sect moved on, building
a place for ourselves in America. There’s
still some seething hatred towards us among some, but we don’t care. This is a land of opportunity for the hard-working
and self-reliant; now, those are hyphenated words with meaning. We're not hyphenated Americans, though. We're just Americans.

    There's the rub. You 'believe' you don't get special treatment, but that is a delusion.

    As long as you're name is 'Emily' and 'Greg', things are a bit different if you're name is 'Lakisha' or 'Jamal'.

    I know you really really want to believe that racism is all gone, but the facts don't support that claim. As for the past, you're keen on pointing out the suffering of your ancestors, but you don't want to admit that African Americans had a worse kind of horror overall.

    Your ancestors may have been poor, but there was a chance of success. Not for blacks.

    Your ancestors may have been persecuted, but at least they were free to choose their spouses and live with them raise children together. Many slave families were destroyed by slavery.

    Your ancestors may have been had a hard time, but were they systematically persecuted by the government, as late as the early 1960s.
==================================

        Most resumes are posted via e-mail these days. If you have the necessary education and your credentials are good you're most likely to get a call back. How many blacks do you know with names like Jamal and Lakisha? Let's see how I make out. My niece's boyfriend is from Jamaica and his name is Cliff. There's John who's from Kenya, Peter from Cambridge, Marissa at work, Valerie at work, hmm...no matter how many of my black friends I think of there's no one with the name Lakisha and Jamal. I knew a kid named Jamal in High school, but he was from Puerto Rico. I don't get your point. The first self made woman millionaire in the U.S. was Madame C.J. Walker who made her money selling homemade beauty products in the black communities of New York City. She had a good product, good sales skills, and tapped into an untapped market. If she had your self pitying, self defeating attitude she never would have succeeded. By the way, she became a millionaire in the year 1900.
==================================

            "I don't get your point."

            That's pretty clear. I've offered you clear evidence of racial discrimination, and you've wandered off into anecdotal tangents..

            "If you have the necessary education and your credentials are good you're most likely to get a call back".

            That's not what the results of the study show. Now if you take the position that research studies are not valid, then our conversation has to be over because we have no common reference point for determining 'facts'.
==================================

        Some of my ancestors were native American. do you and your family owe me something? As my grandfather said when one idiot teacher of mine complained that life was unfair for the natives of this country and I asked him if it would have been better for his ancestors if Europeans hadn't arrived, "That's history. There's a lot to be said for indoor plumbing in the winter. And besides, sweetheart, I have you." Why don't you love what you've got right now and stop looking for reasons to resent everyone over the past?
==================================

            You're arguing with yourself. I never said that anyone 'owes' African Americans anything. That's your idea of what I believe. I just clearly pointed out that your belief that racism is gone in the US is a fantasy.

            I also pointed out that the experience of slavery in united states in uniquely awful, even as many other experiences are awful to a lesser degree.

            Rocky, you seem to be working very hard to find some sort of equality where it doesn't exist. You want the experience of your, or my ancestors, to be equivalent to the experience of slaves. Sorry, buddy, but it just wasn't. Slavery carried some unique special horrors that our ancestors did not have to endure.

            You also want to believe that equality now exists between all races, but the facts don't support that view.

            Perhaps you might understand better if you actually tried to imagine what being a slave actually meant. Imagine losing your family at the whim of a another person. Think about that for just one minute and that empathy alone might change your mind about slavery not being that bad.
==================================

                You're putting words into my mouth and thoughts into my head that don't exist. The point I've most been trying to make is that dwelling on negatives in a way meant to build resentment is counterproductive on all levels. I never said that equality between all races exists. The first family are of African descent, things look more than equal for them. If you really want to achieve something in life you need to concentrate on your strengths and envision a positive outcome for yourself, no matter who you are or what you look like. I've met more black people who foster discriminatory feelings toward whites than I have whites who foster those feelings toward blacks. I went to Portugal with my husband on business. A woman we met there told us that slavery existed in Portugal and that it was tragic ugly and brutal, but that after it ended this constant breast beating that happens in the U.S. didn't occur. Now I concede that we live in a more diverse and complicated society than exists in Portugal, but the woman I spoke to was making the point that from where she and her co-worker stood it appeared that there were people in the U.S. who made a point of carrying on the sense of misery over slavery to the point beyond what is productive. It's difficult to insist that we all treat eachother with respect while simultaneously telling one segment of the population that their ancestors had it worse than anyone else, the deck is stacked against them, everyone else is going to be unfair to them, and therefore, they deserve special treatment. I never said in my post that slavery wasn't horrible, tragic and cruel. I also never said that discrimination doesn't still exist. What I did say is that it's not productive to constantly go on about how different we all are and how unfair everything is for one particular group. More often than not you're going to have to earn respect in this life rather than demand it.
==================================

                    "Sure discrimination exists"

                    That belief is an exception here and in conservatives in general, which is why I posted.

                    The government does have a role in leveling the playing field. The civil rights act was a great example of that -- it began a sea change in the US (and in the south even more).

                    The larger point is that racism still is a corrosive in our society and arguments like the one you've been making support that racism. When you say 'my ancestors had it hard', you're denying the truth that blacks have been in a uniquely terrible posiiton,and it wasn't just 150 years ago. It's still a problem today as evidenced by my original post. Many of the people who read your post here are not as reasonable as you and are encouraged by your focus on your white ancestors. This kind of focus discourages the empathy that is the key to a better understanding of where blacks are coming from when they are upset about racism.

                    I'm not advocating 'balancing' the scales in the way that many conservatives complain about, but there are a lot of things going on with race that you're not aware of, and I try to raise that awareness. I agree that it is difficult to address racism, but I don't think ignoring it is the best course, Your attitiude of 'bad stuff happens, what are you going to do' seems misguided to me.

                    Notice also that you had to to go back 28 years for your story. I'd bet a lot of money that almost all african americans only have to go back a week or so to find an example. That's a big difference.
==================================

                        Last week my sister was watching t.v. with a bunch of her girlfriends, all of whom were black, and they made a derogatory joke about white women while watching a show featuring an attractive white woman. My sister is dark like my Dad. she had to remind her friends that she's white and she didn't think the joke was funny. Racism involves dividing people according to their race. If you don't like it don't be a racist, no matter who you are.
==================================

    Sisu! I totally agree with everything you say, and it's refreshing to hear it from someone else for a change. My mother was from Canada, my father's mother was from Canada, and I'm a mix of so many different ethnic backgrounds that most of my ancestors would have been battling each other historically at one point in time or another. Luckily they got over it and had lots of descendants. None, zero, zilch, absolutely none of my ancestors, going all the way back to the 1100s where I can trace them ever owned any slave of any color. All of my family has worked hard for what we have. None of my husband's ancestors have ever owned a slave and a good many of them fought for the north in the Civil War which ended slavery which brings me to my next point. 500,000 white men died in the Civil War to end slavery. Was their blood not enough to satisfy the grievance racket in today's world? No, of course not, because the Jesse Jacksons of the world make a living off of trying to manipulate other people. I've been gainfully employed in one way or another with the exception of about four years in which I had just given birth, since I was 14. I've cleaned hotel rooms, cleaned other people's houses, laid sheet rock, painted houses, worked at a sandwich counter, at a deli, at a service bar, at a daycare center, and since I finished nursing school twenty years ago, as an RN. My hands show a lot of wear and tear. How is it that my hard earned labor shouldn't be my own, that I shouldn't gain by my own merits because of the color of someone else's skin? Have Jesse Jackson, president or any of his family ever done the kinds of manual labor that I've done? If you took a good look at their hands you could tell. I'd say the answer is, 'no.'
==================================

        "500,000 white men died in the Civil War to end slavery.".

        No, 250,000 of those men were dying to keep slavery going.
==================================

            BTW It's always good to do a little research before you quote statistics. What I learned in grade school was at least 500,000. Official statistics quote a much higher number of at least 620,000 with the Union (that means the north) soldiers taking the largest share at 320,222, so statistically more men died to end slavery than to keep it and divide the country. Remember the South started this war because they wanted to separate from the north and divide the United States all together, the circumstances leading to this were do to conditions created by the existence of slavery. So, ask yourself this question, would the country be better off if slavery had never existed? It would have been for all of those men who died. Why don't you honor their sacrifice and look for a way to make a positive contribution to this country? http://www.civilwarhome.com/ca...
==================================

            Yet, they died just the same. It may not matter to you, but it mattered to them and their families. Most of the Confederates who died in the Civil War were not slave holders. As I said, no one alive in this country is guilty of legal slavery. No one has been for more than 150 years. Most Americans are not even descended from slave holders. Stop trying to hold hard working Americans responsible for something they have nothing to do with.
==================================

    The customary teaching on the Boston Massacre is a perfect example of the "contrived history" of which you speak. For far too many teachers, the only pertinent detail of the event seems to be that a black man was among those killed. Years later, most students won't remember why the British were garrisoned in Boston in the first place, what the immediate cause of the massacre was, how many died, or which famous American defended the soldiers at their trial. Yet they will remember the name Crispus Attucks and that he was black.
==================================

Indeed the idea was well intended and likely served its purpose well but recent times have rendered obsolete. For we live in an age of affirmative action (government sponsored discrimination), political correctness (government sponsored censorship) and the new phenomenon (and most dangerous) of ‘diversity’ (government sponsored separatist movement).

We no longer need to educate America about Americans; we need to educate Americans about America.

No more should we focus on groups of Americans but focus our collective conscience on America. To do other risks separatism and chaos which I believe is the exact aim of the Diversity Movement.

The majority of Americans are good natured folks and they honestly desire to show empathy to people of other cultures but their inherent goodness leaves them susceptible to the malicious manipulations of Diversitists who want to eliminate American culture.

Diversitists seek to categorically divide us in a contrived manner specifically to weaken our national bond. They engender separation, alienation, and animosity. All volatile substances of the human psyche which when mixed together create quite an unstable formula. Add to that the accelerant of economic despair (a secret formula it seems our government has been compounding in these past few years) will make a toxic, explosive and lethal brew.

It’s unfortunate, the anti American diversity zealots are a small minatory but like Marx before them they have created wonderful sounding rhetoric that has such an intoxicating effect upon good natured and well meaning Americans.

So potent its fumes seem to have a soporific affect on the author as well or perhaps it’s just the expected result from ubiquitous Diversity Studies that have wafted into the educational ether and allowed us to forget that YES whites too were segregated, discriminated against, and immigration restricted (i.e. Jews, Irish Italians, Catholics, German, even home grown Mormons, etc ,etc). You aint American unless you’ve overcome adversity, it should serve as a source of pride that we have all overcome together.

And all had either overcome or were well on the way until the government via affirmative action, welfare and the like sanctioned once again segregation upon us; especially those that worked so long and hard to overcome (ending slavery, the civil rights movement, etc). It’s the political miracle of our age that this neo segregation is an overwhelming Liberal-Democratic construct yet they have successfully slandered the Republicans as discriminatory.

Our history is replete with glory, tragedy, inspiration and indignation that all Americans have faced, benefitted from and triumphed over. Now is not the time to revert to a Liberal inspired barbarous past. To avoid this fate we Americans must recognize we indeed are Americans, be proud of it, and celebrate together our history, its soaring beauty along with ugly warts. We are America. To forget such would be not only un-American but our undoing.
==================================

To me, Black History Month smacks of covert racism. It says that the only reason these people matter is because of the color of their skin, and not the accomplishments they achieved. I teach high school English, and great black writers such as Langston Hughes, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Morrison, et al, are part of my curriculum throughout the year. When students ask if we are doing anything special for Black History Month, I always tell them that I refuse to give short shrift to great writers by only studying them during the shortest month of the year.

==================================

    "Indeed the idea was well intended and likely served its purpose well but recent times have rendered obsolete."

    That's the problem with so many liberal ideas. They seem well-intended, but in time are often rendered obsolete and most of the time, cause more problems than they solve.
==================================

One more problem with Black History Month: it has become corny.
==================================

Perhaps we could establish a French history month? We could celebrate all the various French groups that populated Canada and the United Sates.

You could have a French Canadian Week, a Cajun / Acadian week, a week for descendants of Napoleon's exiled supporters and a week for Lafayette and all the French forces who provided assistance during the Revolutionary War. We could also celebrate all the French Canadians who immigrated to America during the 19th and early 20th century with a big documentary or something.

Lincoln once stated that the best way to get a bad law repealed, was to "religiously enforce it". What better way to challenge the lefties, than to use their own ideas and rules against them. Perhaps then, the lefties will stop to reconsider their present course of action. Unlikely to happen, but you can at least better expose the hipocrasy of the leftist agenda.

==================================

by the way, there is no white history month because every month is white history month.

==================================

    Really? From March to January students learn only 'white' history at the exclusion of all other races?
==================================

i am very amused by the national review's and the neocon's in general embrace of martin luther king. glenn beck, the nra, gosh, how far we've come as a nation.

==================================

    Jews.
    You want to say it. Go ahead. No one will think less of you. Not possible.
==================================

    Not eliminate and not every black POTUS...Conservatives would have liked to have seen president defeated in the election. His ideology strikes at the heart of all we abhor. I would vote for Allen West in a skinny minute, and I have many Conservative friends who feel likewise. Your assumption that a dislike of the Pres has anything to do with race, shows your tendency toward racialism and bears no empirical evidence of racism.
==================================

        You mean the one term Congressman Allen West? Yeah, he's certainly qualified.
==================================

    Not black economists, though.

    The average conservative would probably be willing to crawl on our hands and knees across a field strewn with broken glass and rusty nails is Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams agreed that it would fix what's wrong with America.
==================================

    Damnit! You've discovered my true aim! Not being particularly eloquent, I didn't manage to convey it in my piece—in fact I wrote the complete opposite—but you read between the lines and found the racism. Well done!
==================================

    The paranoia is strong in this one.
==================================

"They are an integral, inextricable part of the country’s past, present, and future. The curriculum should treat them as such." when are they going to start this part?
==================================

    When was the last time you were in a classroom?
==================================

I think this is the first article posted in the National Review that I wholeheartedly agree with. And to think, I clicked the article expecting the "why is there no white history month" nonsense. So shame on me.
ETA: of course, the comments are the usual NRO stew of white resentment. But still, good on you Cooke.

==================================

    I agree with this. It's not an article I was expecting to agree with, but it makes its case-and fairly. On the other hand, I see it more as thought-provoking than actually a policy platform, since any attempt to bring it about would become exactly the kind of seething mass of resentment you talk about, and get laughed out of town.

    I think as school history zeroes in on the ultimate hypocrisy of American history-the republic of the free built on top of slave labor and segregation-and considers that as a lens to view every part of American history-Black History Month will become irrelevant. I think a lot of 'patriots' might prefer that black history stayed something for February alone.
==================================

        The people in the north were free, and the north was responsible for most of the growth and innovation in the ante-bellum U.S. The south was a mess because of slavery. The south depended on the north for all of it's manufactured goods and a good deal of its raw materials. It was this resentment that instigated the secession movement in the first place, not just the friction over new states being free or slave. The majority of whites in the south were poor and uneducated because there were no working class jobs available, they were all done by slave labor. There was no booming industry in the south. Any hopes of producing an educated class capable of innovation were quashed by dependence on slave labor removing the necessity to change labor practices for the better. Yet, consider this, there's no African country that would be better to live in than the US. today. I'd rather be a black American descended from slaves than an African anywhere in Africa. I have good friends who have immigrated here from Africa and every one of them says that they wish they were born here even if it meant that their ancestors had endured the cruelty of slavery because they are desperate to become American citizens. This country offers more opportunity to everyone, regardless of race, than any other country in the world. If that weren't true we wouldn't have so many people trying to come here.
==================================

        Or we could teach just plain history, valuing critical thinking over partisan indoctrination.
==================================

    Good for you! Glad to see you could open your eyes a little. And I'm really hoping no one spastically down-votes your comment, as I imagine some of our cruder readers are tempted to do.

    In the interest of continuing open-minded dialog, I'd be curious to see which comments you consider "white resentment." Maybe I'll learn something in return!
==================================

I can hear the fake outrage now: "OMG! NRO wants to get rid of Black History Month! Racists! All of them! Racists!"

*facepalm*
==================================

    Yes, remind me again: how many NRO columnists have had to be "disappeared" this past year for having links to White Supremacist organizations?
==================================

        Eh, I have no idea what you're talking about.

        Even if it's true, at least NRO gets rid of racists, whereas left-leaning media specifically hires them for that particular credential.
==================================

    See, this is how things get turned around against all logic. Why isn't it more apparent that the people who insist on continuing Black History Month are Racists!?
==================================

Is there really a Caribbean-American Heritage Month? When? I didn't know!
I'm seriously asking.
(I do agree it's ridiculous to have all these theme months, by the way, especially if each one is going to show up every year. I could live with it if they did them once a decade.)
==================================

Given how often it's been abused by those who farcically claim every civilizational achievement to have appeared in Africa first, and that it occurs in the truncated month of February, Black History Month is neither black, nor history, nor a month. It is the perfect metaphor then for racialism.
==================================

    You, sir, are on fire today! Well, well said.
==================================

        The truth will be told sooner or later, and oppression of the many by the few never lasts - even when the few are the descendants of the former oppressed.
==================================

        The truth will be told sooner or later, oppression of the many by the few never lasts even when the few are the descendants of slaves.
==================================

Few things offend against justice and damage the common good more than our omnipresent hard government sanctioned institutionalized racial discrimination against white people in general, and white men in particular. The time has long past when this might have ever been considered justified. The overwhelming opportunity offered to all blacks, regardless of the content of their character, has made them a ruling class. They are over represented everywhere by the racial spoils system. This cannot, and will not, last. And the same simmering anger, hatred and bitterness that grew up among blacks against whites is now growing up in whites against blacks. Furthermore, whites are not a small, old and dying group: whites are almost 70% of the population today and will still be the greatest single group beyond 2050 when they will still be 50% while the second largest group, Hispanics, will be only 30%. If I were black, I would bear in mind how hard it is to reverse racial antagonism and I would be trying to make peace with 7 out of 10 people in this country instead of trying to demoralize them as Obamba does at every turn. I would remember that the lessons of history: a small minority cannot rule over a vast majority for ever, and the more they oppress them the worse will be the result for them when they lose power, as they always do.
==================================

It's a bit quaint, but Black History Month does not really bother me all that much (even seems kinda poetic it is the shortest month of the years). What I do not understand is the resentment the Right has for it and MLK's birthday; especially when they would fall over backward and pee all over themselves if a Ronald Reagan Birthday was ever proposed.

==================================

    What they resent is the loss of Lincoln and Washington's Birthdays into "president's day." Forming our nation against the efforts of the world's greatest military, and then freeing the slaves and establishing for all time that we will remain a nation and not split apart, will always be vastly more important for all of the people that will ever live here no matter who they are. Lincoln and Washington are still by far the greatest leaders and the most moral people we have ever been lucky enough to have. and deserve to recognized as such.
==================================

        Well, there is the worry about the proliferation of Holidays. One of the few arguments with which I sympathized during the MLK Day debate, btw...
==================================

    I'm not sure conservatives would, um, contort themselves so to advocate Reagan Day. Clever and evocative imagery, though!
==================================

    My personal problem with it is having mixed-race children, and I'm trying to raise them up with my world outlook that Race Does Not Matter, and every February in their early elementary years they were coming home confused about their identity because the Black History stuff in school was causing them to think their identity depended on them figuring out what race they are. So on a personal level I resented it for that.

    Less personally -- I agree with the others' points: the material is repetitious; the need is obsolete; it's continuing to segregate one race from the whole and treat that race separately; this is unhealthy for American society. We are supposed to be One Nation indivisible (yes, "one nation under God, indivisible" but that's a separate argument). The Melting Pot, yes?

    Finally please note that MLK is the only individual unelected American to have a Federal holiday for him. It CANNOT be true that no other is equally or possibly more deserving. In my view this is not an argument for more Federal holidays commemorating individual citizens; it's an argument against having any.
==================================

        It would be nice if race didn't matter in this country for your children and all the other children but unfortunately society has decided otherwise. Remember the 1 drop rule? Well, take it seriously because that means that society will decide what your children are!
==================================

        I sympathize with your first point, Education is always a step behind current wisdom.
        As for MLK Day, I don't think only elected officials should be recognnized. And I consider the day more of a symbol for the entire Civil Rights struggle, and Martin was a reasonable candidate because he advocated peaceful resistance, as taught by Jesus and Ghandi. Hence there will be no Malcom X day, thank goodness!
==================================

        Tell that to your fellow redneck Conservatives who say president is "black" (not mixed-race, raised by his white mother and white grandparents), who say he was born in Kenya, and call him Muslim because of his name and his father. Race doesn't matter? Not according to the Republican Party (who work solely against blacks and hispanics - sorry, the "takers") and the hard-right readers of the NRO.
==================================

            According to media reports -- from the regular, friendly-to-president media -- HE chose to claim on his Census form that he is "black" (not mixed-race). This was in the last Census, and the form that year was designed in such a manner that a person could identify himself as mixed-race (with specifics).
==================================

            I hope we can agree that evoking hateful stereotypes about large classes of people is something we all should strive to avoid.
==================================

        Wrong. Federal Holidays include both Washington's Birthday and Columbus Day. You can look it up here http://www.opm.gov/policy-data...
==================================

            Columbus was not a US citizen to the best of my knowledge, so (although I'd forgotten about his holiday) not relevant.

            I find on the OPM official page that you are in fact right that Washington's Birthday is still the official name of the holiday appearing on most calendars as Presidents' Day. Therefore I've edited my comment.
==================================

You're assuming good faith on the part of the educators who promote Black History Month. I suspect their intention is to aggrevate our culture's fissures and thereby rend apart America to clear space for their revolutionary utopia.
==================================

It is nice to see such a wonderfully liberal position taken in the National Review online. Yes, we need our history fully integrated, as suggested by Morgan Freeman, and we need people to accept that it is normal, right and acceptable to have a Black man in what has been, by tradition, a White house. Cooke writes of a perfect America where whites, blacks, Irish and Italians all all acknowledged for their contributions. Then the raucous begins with comments suggesting an underlying racism that is at the heart of the conservative movement. Yes, we want everyone to have equal opportunity, wink, wink, smile, smile. Yes, we believe all should be recognized by their contributions, wink, wink, smile, smile. Yes, we believe we have finally given African Americans proper recognition for building much of the nation, wink, wink, smile, smile.

The day will come when there is no need for a Black History month. We are getting there. But the pure hatred for our president simply because he is an African American demonstrates that we are not there yet. The day will come when the winks and smiles of racists turn into honest recognition that we are all equal in the eyes of God, and that Jesus died for all, not just white men . . . wink, wink, smile, smile.

==================================

    you must not know any conservatives or republicans or you wouldn't have such a dishonest, bigoted view of them. What policies and positions of president's do you agree with? I have many liberal friends. In 2008 I asked everyone of them why they voted for president and to a man, black, white, or red, they answered, "Because he's African American." If anyone told you that they voted for McCain because he's white (and I defy you to find anyone who did) you would think they were racist. Yet, it's the most ridiculous racism to vote for president because he's black. Like I said, cite his policies that you agree with. How's the 7.9% unemployment and the increased unemployment in the black community suiting you? Do you agree with his policy of legalizing abortion to term, or using federal funds to pay for abortion, and of leaving babies born alive to botched third trimester abortions to die? How about the punishing regulations that president has put on the coal industry? Do you support his Fast and Furious program which sold guns in large quantities to gangs and drug dealers on the border of Mexico resulting in the deaths of over 300 people? How about president's policies in the Middle East which have completely destabilized the region and are bringing Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon, are those his policy positions that you support? I suppose you support the way that he bowed to every tyrannical leader he visited after he became president. It must make you happy that president was the preferred candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood. I don't suppose it bothers you that great black men and women such as Justice Clarence Thomas, Alan Keyes, Alan West, Mia Love, and Condi Rice have been derided and depicted in racist ways by the liberal mainstream media because they are black conservatives. They must be extremely brave to leave the democrat template for how they're supposed to behave because they know the nasty treatment they're going to get. By the way MLK was a Republican. It was the democrats in the south who were turning their fire hoses on black and white protesters. The democrats are the only party to have members in the KKK, the last of whom died only a few years ago, a democrat senator til the end. I bet nobody will be teaching those facts during black history month. Your accusations show your ignorance and hypocrisy.
==================================

    It would indeed be OK to have a black man as president. But, by the way, the current president isn't black. He's biracial. The fact that he and the racial-grievance-mongering establishment all find it necessary to define this biracial person by only part of his family (and, at that, not even the part of his family that raised him) says something most unpleasant about THEIR attitude to race.
    This president is roundly disliked in many quarters for his policies, his principles, his politics and his personality. I assume those are the same reasons his predecessors have all been disliked in (varying) quarters. So, how does racism come into this?
==================================

    This is not a liberal position -- it is a human position. Let me say once and for all that opposition to this president has ZERO to do with the color of his skin. I vehemently oppose all socialist-leaning liberal loonies, regardless of their cloak. Most of us already honestly recognize that we are all equal in the eyes of God. Your blind acceptance that conservatives are all racist is just as bad as racism itself.
==================================

        That's right.
==================================

        I agree the looney right doesn't hate president because of his skin color. They do detest his policies first. They then use that to justify their racism. If he was a woman and white, the secondary reactions would be sexist. If he was white and gay, the secondary reaction would be to mock that. Because that's what _people_ do. Democrats did the same with both Reagan and Bush Jr - disagreed with the policy and then mocked the fact that both men were intellectually challenged (the same is done with Rick Perry, Palin and Bachman).
==================================

            "The fact that both men were intellectually challenged" doesn't happen to be a "fact" at all.
==================================

            That's the most ridiculous load of crap I have ever heard! Only liberals are incapable of seeing people as people. I don't look at individual people, whatever their race, gender, smarts, sexual orientation, or whatever as anything but people. i judge people on the content of their character. I agree or disagree with politicians based solely on whether they fit in with my preferred policies. I couldn't care less about anything else.

            We aren't even Americans anymore.nEveryone is some kind of hyphenated-American. In left wingnut looneyland, everyone has to carry some label, and libs are always trying to divide us into various victim groups. Seems to me that's where the racism, sexism, etc. lie.
==================================

    "But the pure hatred for our president simply because he is an African American demonstrates that we are not there yet."

    That is a cheap and sleazy way of trying to make it toxic for people who disagree with this president's policies to voice their disagreement. But those policies are in the mainstream of the Democratic Party's policy aims. I daresay if John Kerry — the very thinnest cream of the white elite — were president, we would see identical policies. And I daresay most conservatives would hate those policies to the exact degree they hate president's.
==================================

Few things offend against justice and damage the common good more than our omnipresent soft bigotry of low expectations. This form of bigotry is pandemic on the Left, but it infects the Right, too. The worst thing is, the victims of it often enjoy being the victims of it, so they never speak up against it. One can do little about this injustice other than to try one's best to call garbage "garbage," whether the person produced it has black skin or white skin.
==================================

    Few things offend against justice and damage the common good more than our omnipresent hard government sanctioned institutionalized racial discrimination against white people in general, and white men in particular. The time has long past when this might have ever been considered justified.
==================================

I posted this last year; it still applies:
My five year old granddaughter loves the movie "The Blind Side." She loved Michael Oher, and it is one of those movies she, as kids do, could watch over and over. We live in an area where there are very few people of color, no reason; it's just the way it is. Since I do not care about skin color and in turn my daughter doesn't, she, the granddaughter has never noticed it. She just liked Michael for what he was as a person, you know, the character thing.
I realized I was seeing and enjoying the innocence of a child and it did my heart good.
Then one day she came home from school (kindergarten) and informed us that some people are black or have dark skin and we as white people were very mean to them. I wasn't quite sure how to explain this to her, but it made me very sad. I and her mother eventually told her that skin color doesn’t mean anything, it is like hair color. She is too young, in my opinion, to learn about wrongs of the past and how they were corrected. I just want her to be young and innocent for a while longer. As I said the whole thing made me sad.

==================================

    When I was in nursery school I had a crush on Peter who was black and it didn't matter because I was four and nobody said anything to me. My Dad was a hippie. One of his best friends was, and is, a black guy who was married to a white woman. If you don't say anything to kids they don't know the difference, but you're right that the public schools do everything they can to point out how different we all are from each other. Speaking of allowing kids to be innocent, be forewarned, here in liberal Massachusetts we sent our younger kids to parochial school to avoid their having to hear in inappropriate detail all about what it means to be homosexual and why this is o.k. How about teaching kids to be nice to everyone and refraining from telling them about adult intimate choices. You're right. Kids aren't allowed to be innocent anymore.
==================================

    "People of Color".
    Lord, how I despise that term. Am I clear? Am I invisible? White/tan is a color. I know it is because I can buy that color at Sherwin Williams and it's in every box of Crayola's.
==================================

        Police officer: "And can you tell us, was the perpetrator colored?"

        Fred Sanford: (long pause) "Yeah, white."
==================================

        My color is a pale, rose-beige.
==================================

        I hate it also, but couldn't thing of another way. I should have wrote "so called people of color" or somethung.
==================================

To take the authors point, why not just change February from Black History month to "Under-Appreciated, Disrespected and Ignored" History Month? Or just "Whiner's Month" for short?

==================================

My small grade-school class was mostly white, but there were a number of black, Asian, and other non-white students. I remember that these differences in skin color were utterly unremarkable to me, no more outstanding than different hair color. Until we started talking about slavery and the civil rights era, at which point our teachers singled out those students for their racial difference, like Cooke's Malawi cousin.

I don't want to eliminate slavery or the civil rights movement from grade-school history, but I sometimes miss that true, innocent color-blindness, before those topics were introduced.
==================================

    That color-blindness was probably only experienced by the majority white kids. You can bet the black kids already knew about slavery before they went to that school, and of course already felt the differences of being black in a majority white school. I remember when I was a kid I'd think about what it must have been like for the one or two black kids in our mostly white classroom, and try to imagine how I'd feel if the situation were reversed. I'm sure I'd feel different even if all the other kids were friendly to me. I think that's natural.
==================================

        I don't know. I lived in Cambridge, Mass. as a kid. No one in nursery school or kindergarten seemed to pay any attention to skin color. It wasn't until I got into elementary school and the black kids who were in the majority began to beat up the minority white kids that I really noticed the difference. Racism can be practiced by anyone regardless of skin color. MLK knew this and that was why he said that he wanted people to be judged by the content of their character. He meant everyone. The black kids who were bussed into our high school when I was older and we lived in another town segregated themselves. The black kids who had grown up in that town and attended the public schools all along hung out with everyone. If you don't like racism, don't be a racist. Don't pretend that you can read the minds and hearts of everyone else.
==================================

            I don't pretend anything. I was merely making an observation that the one or two black kids in my class as a child were probably not color-blind like we think. I never accused anybody of racism, least of all my own elementary classes. But it's human nature to feel different if you are the only one of a certain race in a group of people. I've been the only white person in a group of black people, and I was acutely aware of it at the time. I didn't feel threatened or disliked, just different.
==================================

                My Mom gave me some good advice when I was a kid, "Smile and be nice to people. Nice people will like you. Mean people won't which is fine because you don't want to hang out with them anyway." My Dad is half native American. He also left my Mom when I was less than two. There were times when I definitely felt different being the only kid in the neighborhood from a family with no dad, but I followed my Mom's advice, made friends, and stopped worrying about it.
==================================

        I'd of course have to ask them, but I honestly don't believe those kids felt singled out, at least not until we started talking about MLK.
==================================

Rescinding MLK day and restoring "Presidents" day to Washington's and Lincon's birth-days would also correct in injustice. The enactment was PURE RACISM and not at all in the national interest.

==================================

    I'm not surprised that resentment over MLK would surface. It's racism pure and simple.
==================================

        So far, there are 7 responses to James Pethokoukis's piece on lousy GDP and employment being the new normal, and 102 on Black History Month.
==================================

    Rescinding MLK day and keeping Presidents' Day as a recognition of multiple presidents would mean no individual American being honored with a Federal holiday -- probably a very appropriate situation in a republic.
==================================

    Yes it was. Those who understood history and the lessons of it protested at the time - those who did not know any better acquiesced and have been proven very wrong.
==================================

        Why? MLK is an icon for democracy and how to make a case for justice: show dignity, show authority, always wear a smart suit and tie, don't fight with guns, but make the world see the brutality of your opponents.

        He made the case, not for special treatment, but that black people had the right to sit down at a bar and order a milkshake like anyone else. And he paid the ultimate price for standing up and saying so.
==================================

            You're right, but I think he'd sit down and cry if he could see the condition of black America now. The liberals have manipulated so many people in this community into depending on liberal policies and programs that they act like children and vote for their own destruction. So many good and honorable hard working black Americans, like Herman Cain, are set up and ridiculed by the liberal elites. Yet, guys like Herman Cain, Justice Clarence Thomas, Alan Keyes, Allen West, Tim Scott and Mia Love and Condi Rice were what MLK was hoping for. Men and women who were successful on their own merits, not because of a handout.
==================================

                        If it were actually true that president's policies have been so devastating to African Americans, then why does he enjoy such incredible support with them?

                        Of course, the alternative is that you've drawn incorrect causal links between president's policies and the negative outcomes. And , not surprisingly, you've failed to recognize the recovery from the brink of a depression, passage of a health care bill that would have been a republican dream only 30 years ago, the repeal of dadt and support for marriage equality (which I am sure you are against, until you realize a family member is gay), and the list goes on.

                        But honestly, rocky, I don't have the time to debate all of president's policies with you, or even continue this discussion, but I will be happy to read one more reply so feel free to take the last word on this.

                        I will say, that despite my complete disagreement with you, I do appreciate that your arguments are expressed in a respectful tone, which is kind of rare for NRO.
==================================

                            I have plenty of friends who are gay, and here in Massachusetts they can get married if they want to. I didn't start to get upset with the homosexual community until they started suing Catholic adoption agencies forcing all of those agencies in Mass. to close, and insisting that homosexuality be part of the public school curriculum starting in kindergarten. I think the public schools in my town were doing an excellent job of teaching the kids to treat each other with respect without pointing out differences. Personally, I don't care if there's a black history month. Things were painfully difficult for blacks in this country since they were brought here against their will, but I think it's important to point out that the sacrifice to bring this to an end came out of the white community. There are good people and bad people everywhere in the world. Most of us, myself especially, are a mixture of both, trying our best to be good, but knowing that it's a daily struggle. It's not my job to judge anyone but myself. That's God's job. Thankfully, the same God who judges us also loves us more than we understand. If God who is perfect loves us then who are we not to love and forgive each other? I hope that being respectful isn't rare for NRO. I have to admit to getting frustrated with some of the posts I find in articles I read and getting pretty snarky, so thanks for saying that I've been respectful, like most of what I do, I'm always wishing and trying to be good. God bless.
==================================

                You sound like somebody who doesn't know any black people or has set foot in "Black America"
==================================

                    You sound like somebody who makes assumptions about people you don't know.
==================================

I really hope the Right pushs this...it seems very important to them and it'll play so well with their image and the image of the Republican Party.
==================================

    I thought we were supposed to be having a dialog about race.

    Was that president's "hundred flowers"? Invite us to talk just so that he could punish dissenting thoughts?
==================================

    You deal in "images" don't you? Well remember the image of the mean evil racist white man oppressor has begun to lose its power with the rise of another image: a belligerent, arrogant, hateful skinny black man, standing up, chin permanently raised in a defiant bellicose Musollini-Macho pose, who played the race card until it lost its power; and in the process gave an entire generation of young white Americans a permanent reason to call themselves conservatives who are going to defeat all Liberalism as long as they are alive.
==================================

        You forgot to mention that his pants are hanging near to the ground...
==================================

    A history buff would note the Democrats were the party of slavery, the Klan, and Jim Crow. But History Bluff? Not so much.
==================================

        Comparing heroes like Lincoln to today's homophobic, sexist and racist Tea Partiers is just sad. The Republicans of 2013 are even the same ones who voted for Reagan, Bush I or Bush II.
==================================

            What policies of Reagan, Bush the elder and Bush the son do you disagree with? What policies of president's do you agree with? You sound like you're just spouting mainstream liberal trash out of ignorance. Elaborate. Prove your point or expose yourself as an ignorant tool.
==================================

            Where is the evidence that the Tea Partiers are homophobic, sexist or racist?
==================================

                And where is the evidence that Lincoln was not a homophobe or sexist?
==================================

    No, they shouldn't. The correct response to the horrors of slavery and segregation and discrimination is to stop dragging them up, stop making them an issue, and just write segregation down as one of those crazy things people believed in back in the 60s, right next to peace and love.
==================================

    You mean the image of the Party, whose leader, freed the slaves? You mean the image of the Party, whose Congressional members, fought against Democrats to enact the 1964 Civil Rights Act? You (and so many today) seem to suffer from a severe case of Historical myopia...
==================================

        All those Democratic Klan guys became card-carrying Republicans. Just sayin'.
==================================

            Who? Not Robert Byrd, the long time klansman remained a democrat senator until he died a few years ago. The Klan was organized to suppress the Republican party not just black people: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...
==================================

            No. That's simply not the case. Contrary to the left's revisionism, most of the staunch southern segregationists did NOT become Republicans. For example, look at the southern Democrats who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. How many of those men switched their party affiliation to the GOP and how many remained Democrats right up until the day they took their last breath? Most southerner voters continued to cast their votes for Democrats for their state legislatures, governors and congressmen for many years after the historic laws of the mid-1960's. The switch to the GOP in the South didn't happen overnight and it had far more to do with the increasing liberalism of the Democrat Party, overall (i.e., abortion, gay rights, anti-military attitudes, environmental extremism, economic redistributionism, "soft on crime," etc.), than any sense of racial resentment or superiority.
==================================

            Not true. But why let reality get in the way of a good fantasy.
==================================

                Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond were the most prominent people to jump to the RNC.
==================================

                    The RNC should have rejected them like it did David Duke. Each generation sees the world differently. This country is not the same place that it was in the 60s at all.
==================================

                    "Most prominent" or "only"?
==================================

            You mean like Byrd, and Wallace?
==================================

            Robert Byrd!
==================================

                Strom Thurmond!
==================================

                    Not a counterpoint to maksutov's comment, and therefore unresponsive!
==================================

                        Democratic klan guys who became Republicans. Strom Thurmond was the grand daddy of them all. Though that didn't stop the racist hypocrite from fathering a mixed race child out of wedlock. He was OK with that.
==================================

                            Apparently you missed my meaning: m66 says "all" Democratic Klansmen became Republicans. The existence of Robert Byrd falsifies his statement, so I pointed it out. Pointing out that there were Democrat KKK guys who became Republicans does nothing to undermine my point.
==================================

                                Your right, Mak did say all. That's wrong, he should have said most.
==================================

                            If you use Strom Thurmon to represent all white Republicans can we use Robert Byrd, former klansman and lifelong democrat to represent all democrats?
==================================

                                All white Republicans? Who said that? Certainly not I. Many, that would be undeniable. You could make a good case for most. But almost never can you make a case for all, in anything.
==================================

                                    How many? Who else could be compared to that guy?
==================================

                                    Wait, so it's your opinion that a good case could be made that many white Republicans if not most could be represented by Strom Thurmon? I don't know why I've come to doubt your GOP bona fides.
==================================

                                        A good many were, at least in South Carolina. He served as their Senator for 48 years, 34 of those as a Republican. I don't think he gathered many black votes during that stretch. Who do you think was voting for him? Being a Republican doesn't mean I should ignore history, does it?
==================================

                                            So now you're going to claim that you were talking about the literal concept of 'representative'? That would contradict your own comment, because by definition Thurmond represented "most" Republicans in South Carolina, he won the primaries. There's no 'arguable' about it. It is a peculiar Republican who obviously holds so much of their own party in such obvious contempt. But if you want to continue pretending that you're some sort of GOP voter who is just speaking truth to power, who am I to gainsay you? Your comments will continue to speak for themselves.
==================================

                                                Let's try again. I don't think it's even debatable that a great many white voters in the old South switched their allegiance from the Democrats to the Republicans during the 1960's. What was formerly a solid voting block for Democrats both statewide and nationally became a solid base for the Republican Party beginning about 1960. Why? The Civil Rights Movement and the Civil Rights legislation certainly played the main role, but there were other cultural issues as well. Strom Thurmond represents this in his breaking with the Democrats in 1964 as well as his subsequent successful political career. Many Republicans supported the Civil Rights legislation, by the way, and that support was needed to counterbalance the opposition from Southern Democrats. LBJ believed that by signing that legislation "we just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come". He was right.
==================================

                                                    You know a lot more about this than I do, so I'll concede the point to you, but didn't LBJ call black people by the n-word? I didn't think he was such a great guy. Honestly, I wasn't born until the mid 60s, so all of my memories of the time are from a very different perspective.
==================================

                                                        Robert Caro's biographies of LBJ are the gold standard on the subject. Of course they're four weighty volumes so you'd better have plenty of free time. I still haven't gotten to the fourth. Sure he used the N word, coming from his time and place it would have been remarkable had he not. He was a complex man, who helped bring about a fair amount of good, the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, and a good deal of failure, Vietnam and the Great Society. On the civil rights side, PBS did a great documentary on the era called Eyes on the Prize, you might want to check that out, most libraries would have that. Interesting times, the Chinese curse.
==================================

            You can say anything, of course.
            Sometimes (like here) what you say just ain't so.
==================================

                He is not completely wrong. If a non-Hispanic white person thinks blacks should receive inferior treatment from the government on account of their race, that person will probably be less inclined to belong to the political party that favors treating black people better than others. He'd be more likely to join the party that thinks no one should receive superior treatment on account of their race.
                If they were to choose between being a Democrat or a Republican, of course whitey hating blacks vote Democrat. Communists obviously vote Democrat, when choosing between the two. The CPUSA actually endorsed president. When street criminals the Republicans want to lock up vote either Democrat or Republican, of course they mostly vote Democrat. I wouldn't think very many of those who want to destroy America would vote Republican. If they wanted to cast a vote that matters, of course they vote for the Democrat. It's just basic common sense.
                There are bad guys who vote Republican for evil reasons, just as there are bad guys who vote Democrat for evil reasons. The difference is that the Republicans marginalize those rotten groups while the Democrats make their rotten members leaders.
==================================

                    Law-abiding women also vote against the Republicans who want to control their sexuality and take it back a few centuries. Educated and well-off Asian-Americans tend to vote Democrat because they don't like the Republican foreign policy of pre-emptive war. It's just basic common sense, you see.
==================================

                        Totally off topic, but expecting women to take responsibility for their body is not "controlling their sexuality".

                        There's a difference between me controlling something that belongs to you, vs. me asking you to control something that belongs to you - if by control we mean "refrain from letting it get so out of hand that society and/or innocent bystanders are harmed".
==================================

                        Do you really want to go down that road?? Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton (war on women); FDR (Japanese-American Interment Camps)... See my post above re historical myopia.
==================================

                        Oh, is that what it is. I thought it was just misinformed, ignorant banter. In what way have Republicans tried to control women's sexuality? When George W. Bush was president birth control was an ubiquitous as it is now. Abortion wasn't made illegal either. I'm a woman and I vote Republican. Mia Love is a black woman who is also a Republican. Condi Rice is a black woman who is a Republican. Are those mean Republicans chasing us all into the bedroom to steal our nighties? What sex of two centuries ago are you talking about? You mean monogamous sex between married individuals? Is that what you find so offensive? What do you know about the sex lives of people who lived in this country in 1713? You can only speculate, and given your proclivity and that of other democrats to focusing on everyone else's sex lives should the rest of us start speculating about what's not going well in your life?
==================================

                        I know plenty of law-abiding women, myself included, who regularly vote FOR Republicans.
                        The comment about wanting "to control their sexuality and take it back a few centuries" makes no discernible sense.
==================================

    It's not very important at all, sorry to disappoint you, Comrade. It's there, it's topical, and Cooke is right. It's symptomatic, not radical.
==================================

        As Churchill said: this is not the end, nor the beginning of the end, but it is perhaps the end of the beginning. Or in terms even you can understand - don't think this is over fool, it's just begun - you wait and see.
==================================

wow. i can actually agree with some of the points you're making, marking the first time I've ever agreed w/ anything written on this site.

==================================

    Careful, Comrade. The Party's eyes and ears are everywhere.

    For all you know, I am the political cadre charged with supervising this publication. "Kotik", hmmm, sounds rather Russkie, don't it?
==================================

        The NKVD hears all - Beria is a Looper and lives down your street.
==================================

Tell ya what. When you have people who don't refer president in racist terms like monkey or not American and we can have ghetto punks think that jailbirds are role models then we can talk about the elimination of Black History month. By the way,check the meaning of the term "real McCoy."

==================================

    I've never understood why Democrats think that black people look like monkeys. Monkeys have straight hair; black people have curly hair. Monkeys have thin lips; black people tend to have thick lips. Monkeys have small noses; black people tend to have prominent noses.

    The hatred Democrats have historically had for black people outweighs the evidence of their own eyes.
==================================

        "we're not racists"
==================================

        Gee, that's really helpful.
==================================

        Blame Darwin. He's their "god" that came up with the theory of evolution.
==================================

            which theory has every shade of human being somewhat related to monkeys, though, right?
==================================

    There will always be some people who will refer to people different from themselves by demeaning terms.
==================================

    How come it would be racist to refer to president as a monkey (hypothetically; I have actually never seen/heard that) when his predecessor WAS depicted as a monkey in cartoons here and there (I did see those) and they identify with different races?
==================================

        Probably the same reason it's okay for a leftist to say 'ghetto punks', but not okay for non-leftists. Republicans and conservatives are only allowed to criticize old rich white heterosexual men, and even then, they're somehow being hatefully racist towards someone.
==================================

            Probably the same reason it's ok for Woody Allen to make jokes about Jews that would be viciously antisemitic if told by non-Jews.
==================================

                Right, because so many leftists live in the ghetto.
==================================

                Woody Allen makes jokes? But I thought jokes were funny?
==================================

                    Me, too. What gives?
==================================

The problem I have with "black history month" is that kids are taught the same thing every year.

There simply are not enough hours in a school year to waste so many hours every February making the kids learn the same facts, watch the same presentations, and so on.

They spend an enormous effort on teaching the kids to sing songs, going over the events of the civil rights movement until everyone has every detail memorized, and even teaching things that I wouldn't advise teaching kids until they're much older (do little kids really need all the gory details?).

Meanwhile, there are kids reaching fourth or fifth grade unable to read, unable to write legibly - some of them don't even know the alphabet. And there are kids who can tell you all about George Wallace, but who will tell you, straight-faced, that they don't know who George Washington was.

==================================

    It sounds like you resent the civil rights movement.
==================================

        It sounds like you're trying to manipulate us by misconstruing what's been said.
==================================

        Looks like you should reread the comment, because you appear to have completely missed Griffonn's point.
==================================

        It sounds like you can't get past something that happened 40-60 years ago. It's a new century, dude. Stop self-segregating and join America. The civil rights movement was an important event in US and even world history, but don't let the leftists keep picking the scab to make you angry every year.

        The Cambodians have moved on from the Killing Fields, the Vietnamese have moved on from the Vietnam war. The Germans have moved on from us flattening their cities. It's time to move on and stop letting people talk you into being angry all the time.

        Learn that we can have differences without accusing each other of "racist" because we disagree.

        There's enough hatred and anger in the world without people constantly going back to the past for anger.
==================================

    That even bleeds over into churches. In my (former) denomination, the Presbyterian Church USA, children are routinely taught about Martin Luther King Jr in Sunday School. But they couldn't tell you who Martin Luther was.
==================================

        I really hope that doesn't also happen in the Lutheran church!
==================================

    sounds like the issue is an unimaginative and boring school/teachers.
==================================

        There is no way it could be anything but boring when the material you're covering was covered in depth last year...and the year before...and the year before that.

        Elevating the civil rights movement into a month-long celebration is not teaching. It is ritual. It is theater. It is propaganda. But it is not teaching. Teaching eventually ends with mastery and graduation.
==================================

            Isn't it appropriate to endlessly repeat the same racially-focused gobbledygook each February? Ain't you seen the movie? Didn't we live this February last February and the February before and the February before and the February before and the February before...?
==================================

            It's a modern day minstral show.
==================================

            i defer to your expert analysis and knowledge of black history and education.
==================================

Well said, young Mr. Cooke. I take back all those "Limey" slurs I've flung at you. Though it was fun flinging them. Your points are all very sound.

Enough, already.

==================================

LIke everything else around here, I've been reading this for a number of years. Its the same song, same verse, repeated ad-infinitum. So, when do we stop carping about everything and DO something?

==================================

    When BHM isn't needed, and when it can be declared obsolete. When the people putting it forward don't, all too often, (not in this author's case, I grant) look like they still nurse a grudge against that pesky Civil Rights Act of 1964 and don't still think MLK was probably a Commie.

    In other words, probably not in this twentysomething's lifetime.
==================================

        Why do you imagine black history month "isn't needed"?

        What function do you imagine is it serving?
==================================

        "When BHM isn't needed, and when it can be declared obsolete."
        OK, then let's do it!
==================================

Join America, not the black America nor the Italian nor the Irish America. Join plain old America. Some of those that claim to be for equality (including, and maybe especially our government) continue to offer solutions that perpetuate the divide, sometimes by accident and sometimes because it provides them with financial benefit (Jesse Jackson?).

Once people don't expect to be treated "special" by some unique government cutout or handout based upon race or economic background, then there's a great chance that they will become plain old Americans. But the government can help itself either, and keeps getting in the way of full equality with its misguided social engineering.

==================================

        Because you think we are racist.
==================================

        Probably because the lousy GDP and employment numbers have been commented on just about every month for 4 years, and there is no reason to expect them to get any better in the next four. Everything that can possibly be said has been said.
        Might as well move on to a new subject.
==================================

    Sadly, there's incentives for racial balkanization, and too much political and societal hay to be made by continuing to hyphenate Americans.
==================================

    Exactly right. I am Irish-American on one day of the year, St. Patrick's Day. Not only is it the only day of the year I'm an Irish-American but my "Irish-Americanism" is diluted because everybody is welcome to be Irish-American that day. All it takes is a shamrock and a green beer!
    We need to put the emphasis back on American and put the modifiers into the dustbin.
==================================

The article is accurate but good luck banging that drum. We are in the affirmitive action days of race relations with no end in sight. Even the NFL has the Rooney Rule, making no mention of any other race than Black. Right now the non black races are less than equal with "racist" being the silver bullet shot into any who protest. Even to vote against president is enough to load the gun let alone write pieces like this. Hope you have another skill set to fall back on!

==================================

    It struck me las night while the SuperBowl was on, "Where are all the women coaches?". Women make up 50% of the population. We have a rule that states that a team is required to interview a Black man (who represents 12% of the population) for any coaching position but no requirement to interview women (50%) or hispanics (15%).
==================================

        You're being sarcastic, right?
==================================

        Why do you think the NFL created that rule? The NFL has to negotiate with players. Are there female players? Are there black players?
==================================

        What stupidity you display. Are there any female players in the league? The reason that the Rooney Rule exists is that in a league where 70% of the athletes are black, they don't seem to get hired as coaches and executives while retread and no-name white coaches do. No one resents Bill Bilichick, Andy Reid, Bill Parcells or any number of successful white coaches. But some really bad ones get rehired before any black coach is given a chance (including many that have been successful co-ordinators). Only the Klansmen like you and Illinois1 don't see it.
==================================

Good, well-balanced article. I think, ultimately, that Black History Month will become irrelevant simply because so many of the most important aspects in American history become impossible to look at without thinking about the role of black people. The Civil Rights period, the Civil War, the question of to what extent the founders who owned slaves recognised their own hypocrisy-putting black people in one month on their own isn't so necessary now.

==================================

    It's not just the Civil War and the Civil Rights Era. You can't understand anything about America -- including our presidents, our constitution, our courts, our westward expansion, our system of government, anything really -- without dealing with the history of black people in this country.
==================================

    It's already irrelevant. The question is, now that it's irrelevant, how do you get rid of it?
==================================

    As long as hypocrites continue to benefit economically by race baiting and promoting welfare, they have to also promote "affirmative action" and divisiveness like MLK day.
==================================

Aren't we one race...the human race? Can we tell a black person from a white person from an Asian person from DNA. If we can't, why do we discuss things in these terms? It seems to me that the whole discussion derives from a false progressive wedge issue designed to divide us politically.
==================================

    "Can we tell a black person from a white person from an Asian person from DNA. "

    Of course we can. Where do you think the distinguishing characteristics of the several races come from, the environment? Do you think a "white" baby adopted by a black couple will over time become black?

    It is even possible in blacks to determine the Euro/African admixture:

    We analyzed the European genetic contribution to 10 populations of African descent in the United States (Maywood, Illinois; Detroit; New York; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Baltimore; Charleston, South Carolina; New Orleans; and Houston) and in Jamaica, using nine autosomal [ie non-sex chromosome] DNA markers. These markers either are population-specific or show frequency differences 45% between the parental populations and are thus especially informative for admixture. European genetic ancestry ranged from 6.8% (Jamaica) to 22.5% (New Orleans).

    We also estimated the male and female European contribution to African Americans, on the basis of informative mtDNA [mitochondrial DNA] (haplogroups H and L) and Y Alu polymorphic markers. Results indicate a sex-biased gene flow from Europeans, the male contribution being substantially greater than the female contribution. The level of European admixture in these groups ranges from 6.8% in Jamaica to 22.5% in New Orleans. In the northern urban populations, we observed m values between 12.7% (Philadelphia) and 20.2% (Pittsburgh). It is important to note that two independent samples from African Americans living in Philadelphia point to a relatively low European contribution (12.7% and 13.8%, respectively). Southern African Americans show a wide range of European influence, from 11.6% (Charleston) to 22.5% (New Orleans), the lowest and highest values, respectively, observed for the U.S. populations we analyzed.
==================================

        So, to quote our Sec. of State, "What difference does it make?" Who cares? God loves all of us, and if you have the good fortune to be born in this country, we're all Americans.
==================================

    Exactly. But notice how the term "wedge issues" is only applied when republicans need to be minimized. Race is never a wedge when democrats use it to further the division.
    Race is merely the most successful political strategy designed to divide the population into groups who cannot possibly accommodate one another without the government posing as arbiter. The cultural melting pot unique to America must be substituted with identity politics to provide inroads for bureaucratic control.
