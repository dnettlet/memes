Obamacare Medicaid feud to leave 3.6 million uninsured: study

 (Reuters) - Fourteen Republican-led states insurance people state people that oppose expanding Medicaid under President Barack Obama's health reform will leave 3.6 million of their poorest adult residents uninsured, at a cost of $9.4 billion per year by 2017, researchers said on Monday.
The findings, published in the journal Health Affairs, could point to a larger-than-expected impact from the bitter political feud engulfing a major provision of the healthcare reform law due to take full effect next year.
The law calls for Medicaid coverage to be expanded to people with earnings of up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, but a Supreme Court decision last year allowed states to decide whether to participate.
Researchers in two separate Medicaid studies say leaving more adults without coverage also risks buoying mortality rates by blocking access to care, leading to higher costs. The poverty line currently stands at $11,490 for an individual and $23,550 for a family of four, and the current threshold for Medicaid eligibility means the services are often limited to dependent children and their parents, pregnant women and those with severe disabilities including the very old.
Republican-led states such as Arizona, Kansas and Maine are nearing the end of legislative debates on whether to join the Medicaid expansion.
"We're trying to sort of inform the debate. If a state policymaker has the goal of covering as many people as possible and reducing the financial risk for that population, expanding Medicaid is the most rational choice," said Carter Price, co-author of a study by RAND Corp, a nonpartisan think tank that receives government funding.
"It's also better for the state fiscally because states fund a lot of programs for uncompensated care," he added.
BIGGER TOLL
Under Obama's 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the federal government is offering to pay states 100 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid for three years beginning in 2014, declining to 90 percent in subsequent years.
Before the Supreme Court decision, the Medicaid expansion was expected to extend coverage to more than 16 million uninsured people, with incomes of about $15,500 for an individual and $32,000 for a family of four.
The latest estimate from the Congressional Budget Office anticipates 3 million fewer Medicaid recipients than predicted before the Supreme Court ruling.
"Our numbers are certainly higher than theirs. But we're all in the three-to-four million range," Price said.
The RAND study found that 3.6 million people, all of them living below the federal poverty line, would be locked out of Medicaid coverage in 14 states with Republican governors who oppose the expansion: Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.
Those states would forego an estimated $8.4 billion in federal funding for the Medicaid expansion in 2016 alone, while continuing to incur an annual $1 billion cost from caring for the uninsured, RAND found.
The figures could climb higher. According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a total of 20 states have failed to move forward on the expansion. Eight more remain undecided. Those include some with large populations, such as Ohio, Michigan and Arizona, where Republican governors who favor expansion have run into legislative opposition from within their own party.
Some states have decided to let would-be Medicaid recipients obtain subsidized private insurance plans instead through new online marketplaces being set up under the health law. But unlike Medicaid, those plans carry copay and deductible charges that would make it harder for people living below the poverty line to cover out of pocket.
RAND found that if all 14 states in its study opted out of the expansion, they would impede a projected reduction in mortality rates. Fully expanding Medicaid would reduce mortality by 90,000 lives per year, the study said. The number would fall to 71,000 without those states.
A separate study led by researchers at the University of Wisconsin looked at a state health program that covers childless adults with incomes of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
The program, launched in 2009, offers less-generous benefits than the Medicaid expansion that Wisconsin has rejected. But within 12 months of enrollment, beneficiaries had increased outpatient visits 29 percent and emergency room visits by 46 percent. At the same time, costly in-patient care fell 59 percent while preventable hospitalizations dropped 48 percent.
==================================
And as always, these lower income people will fail to pay their medical bills when they get in their car wrecks or get their fat-people heart disease or cancer, the regular things that people get….. and the doctors will send the bills to medicaid anyway. Just like they always do. Yes, blue states. You’ll show us! :)
==================================
So they will go to the hospital, can’t pay their bills and without Medicaid picking the tab, the hospitals will jack up their cost and pass on those added cost to the insurance companies who will raise their premiums. And people wonder why we spend 2 x our GNP of other industrial countries and on average pay 4x the cost. 
==================================
red states, rather.
==================================
 “It’s hard to believe that conservative Republicans would go out and intentionally hurt their fellow Americans, and most conservatives are suppose to be Christian. Shameful.”
Well this is expanding medicaid to covering people beyond poverty, this is not denying healthcare or intentionally hurting anyone. Everyone covered under medicaid now, will continue to be covered under medicaid. So you are wrong. This is 14 states being fiscally smart and turning down the US Government insurance people state when it says it wants transfer its money pit medicaid program to the States to get it off the federal governmment’s books. Oh, and we are going to expand medicaid benefits to millions more people so you can have all of that increase on your books too.
==================================
This is going to be felt during the election. For every action there is an equal or opposite reaction.
==================================
@thenewWorld, simple solution single-payer, put everyone on Medicare, then we are all covered.
==================================
Yes, they will uninsured a lot. Others will get Medicaid. Hospitals, private practice and even nurse practicioners do not accept Medicaid because it is paid low. So, what is point of your text?
==================================
Obama’s health care plan will be written by a committee whose head, John Conyers, says he doesn’t understand it. It’ll be passed by Congress that has not read it, signed by a president who smokes, funded by a Treasury chief who didn’t pay his taxes, overseen by a Surgeon General who is obese, and financed by a country that’s nearly broke. What could possibly go wrong?
==================================
I am for that. Even better, state and local public hospital systems. Attached to universities when possible. Force every medical professional to do their residency at the public hospitals before they can go into private practice. This is one subject that I have moved from conservative to a liberal position on in the last 5 years. We have public libraries, isn’t health much more important?
==================================
Not gonna happen. It’s a business. People make money of others sickness.
==================================
TheNewWorld/Speaker2: You both are absolutely correct. Unfortunately, the powerful healthcare and insurance lobbies won’t allow universal healthcare to happen. Obamacare, a conservative plan, is the biggest improvement to our healthcare system in decades. Even Nixon proposed something similar to the Obamacare plan. It’s easy to criticize Obamacare because we live in a country that won’t allow the kind of change that is really needed, so Obamacare necessarily is wanting. So we either do nothing or a stop-gap insurance state people measure like Obamacare. Doing nothing is unsustainable and the worst thing we could have done. In light of those handicaps, Obamacare makes the most sense until the American public grows enough backbone to stand up to the power elite who have taken our government from us and demand that those we elect to office represent US. Here in Mississippi males aren’t eligible for Medicaid. So if you’re poor (heck you don’t even have to be that poor) and you get sick or have an accident here in Mississippi, you’re just screwed. And, of course, Mississippi is one of those red states with a governor who opposed adopting Obamacare. Sure, people will die and people will go bankrupt, but it plays well politically and that’s what’s important.
==================================
My biggest problem with Obamacare is the mandate that you have to be a customer of a health insurance company simply because you are alive. I think the Federal insurance people government way overstepped its boundaries on that one, but with it being declared a tax it got past the US Supreme Court. It is at least a start though, and there is no doubt in my mind if it had been the Republican’s idea they would all be stepping over top of each other to take credit for finally solving the health care crisis. Unfortunately the ball is in the health insurance industrie’s court on this, and I believe that they see the mandate that you have to be their customer as another excuse to walk all over the customers.
==================================
Obama’s health care is here to stay. Take or leave it. Each governor has to make the choice for their constituents. If you gamble wrong and do not do the expansion, and it cost your state more as you wait for an alternative you only have yourself to blame. This is not only a bias political choice but a risky one. Good luck. 
==================================
I was hauled from a car wreck in 2009 and awakened in what North Carolina disgracefully calls a hospital. There, I received my ration of abuse and mis-diagnosis. My elderly parents came to rescue me from the clutches of a present day Dr Mengele and Nurse Ratchett. With a parent under each armpit and toes dragging behind me,,we left for home. Once there, I lay for several weeks with a broken neck which the hospital said I didn’t have. Seven months later, I had cause to see a doctor and get an x-ray or two. When the x-rays were developed, the Dr. came to the exam room and told me to lie down and wait for an ambulance. After the first go around with N.C. medical care,, I refused the ambulance ride and left. Largely because I had no insurance or any desire to be manhandled by another bunch of “real smart” people. To this day, I have received no assistance from anyone.
My point is: The healthcare crisis has little to do with what is being addressed. It’s more like the system itself is slipshod and insists on getting paid whether it deserves payment or not. Forcing everyone to buy insurance only puts an insurance company in the argument over whether care is given or not. No assurances of quality care have been laid on the table,,,Just assurances of payment. With all the garbage in our air, water and food, it’s unlikely too many folks will leave this life without fattening the purses of insurance companies and the medical industry. I say ,,to hell with all of them!
==================================
Medicare becomes insolvent in 2026 according to CBO under the CURRENT estimates. But if the Senates version of immigration reform passes, Medicare will become insolvent far sooner due to the numbers of over 50 peoples allowed to become citizens (and those they will sponsor to become citizens). Immigration reform yes….but it can not be allowed to destroy the benefits of those who have paid in for decades. This absolutely must be resolved in any immigration reform. Capital switchboard is 202 224-3121…please call to demand that this benefit not be provided for anyone who has not paid their part into the system. Those currently under 50 years of age will be decimated if the current Senate immigration plan is passed.
==================================
Dumping more people into a system that is already failing in most states never made sense to me. Besides, ask Medicaid beneficiaries how hard it is now to find a doctor who accepts their insurance card and then add another 9.6 million people to the list–get ready for long waits from doctors who only have five minutes to diagnose and take care of the patients.
Besides, call me skeptical, but when the Federal government ran out of money for the plan put in place to cover those with pre-ex until the ACA could be enacted, they shifted the cost to the providers and the plan participants in the form of lower payments to providers, higher deductibles and copays. Why would we believe that when the Federal government begins to run out of money to pay all these new subsidies and the cost of medicaid for the states who have taken this option, that they won’t first look to the states to make up the shortfall by reducing the amount the Federal Government will pay? The Democrats took money from Medicare insurance people to pay for the ACA, who says they won’t look to taking money from Medicaid in the future?
The Republicans are doing what the Democrats should have done before launching this costly endeavor, they are looking at their state budgets and figuring out that they can’t take the chance that in the future they will get stuck paying for the majority of the costs.
