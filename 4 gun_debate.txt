Obama takes gun debate on the road: 'It's time to do something'

President Obama took the gun control debate on the road for the first time on Monday, pressuring Congress to take action quickly and telling lawmakers in no uncertain terms, “We don't have to agree on everything to agree it's time to do something."

A seemingly somber and pensive Obama renewed his calls for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in an address before a crowd of law enforcement officials in Minneapolis. But he sounded a more optimistic tone on legislation implementing universal background checks, which stands the best chance of passage.

“We may not be able to prevent every massacre or random shooting. No law or set of laws can keep our children completely safe, but if there's even one thing we can do, if there's just one life we can save, we've got an obligation to try," Obama said at the Minneapolis Police Department's Special Operations Center. “We don't have to agree on everything to agree it's time to do something. That's my main message here today."

While Obama urged Congress to institute a broad set of gun-control proposals, he made clear on Monday that the “vast majority" of Americans — including a majority of gun owners — “support criminal background checks on anyone trying to buy a gun."

“That's common sense," he said. “There's no reason we can't get that done. That is not a liberal idea or a conservative idea. It's not a Democratic or Republican idea. That is a smart idea. We want to keep those guns out of the hands of folks who shouldn't have them."


But Obama said Congress “shouldn't stop there" and urged Congress to restore the ban on military-style assault weapons and reduce the size of magazines. “That deserves a vote in Congress, because weapons of war have no place on our streets or in our schools or threatening our law enforcement officers," the president said.

Obama remarks come amid uncertainty on Capitol Hill on gun control. While many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are beginning to coalesce around supporting mandatory background checks on all firearm purchasers, such measures face strong opposition from conservatives and the powerful National Rifle Association, which has accused Obama of targeting Second Amendment rights.

The Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings last week on gun control, and Chairman Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) says he hopes to move a bill by month's end. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has expressed skepticism about the prospects for passing an assault weapon ban, but says he supports strengthening background checks.

White House aides say they selected Minnesota for Monday's trip because of the state's efforts to help curb gun violence, including background checks. While White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters that it was “premature" to start writing off any element of the president's gun control proposals, aides say they are cautiously optimistic that Congress could pass legislation on background checks.

And while Obama said Monday he was pleased that Congress is finally starting to move on gun control legislation, he added, “You can't count on anything in Washington until it's done, and nothing's done yet."

==================================

Will this President ever return to DC and get involved with direct
representation to the Senate and House? Why is he continuing
these outrageous costs for flights in Air-Force One from City to City? There is no longer a need for campaigning or is there?

==================================

Here is NRA's LOGICAL FALLACIOUS argument against gun control: If the government prohibits you from purchasing AN ATOMIC BOMB then the next thing the government will do is to prohibit you from purchasing a tank or a bazooka; if they prohibits you from purchasing a tank or a bazooka think what the government is going to do next? The government is going to prohibit you from purchasing an automatic or semi automatic assault rifle and if the government prohibits you from purchasing a semi automatic assault rifle think what the government is going to do next? The government is going to prohibit you from using any guns at all: think what is going to come next: the government is going to prohibit you from purchasing kitchen knives; yes knives can you imagine? And this is going to happen if we allowed the government to pass any form of gun control legislation... can you imagine your family starving because you cannot use a kitchen knife? if you cannot use a kitchen knife then what is going to be next? I tell you the government is going to prohibit you from purchasing a car because you can kill somebody with a car. What is going to be next? You cannot be allowed to purchase a pencil because you can kill somebody with a pencil. Therefore it should be concluded that PENCILS ARE AS DANGEROUS AS ATOMIC BOMBS. THEREFORE if people are allowed to purchase pencils, as they are now, which can be very dangerous, then it follows logically under the second amendment that american citizens should be allowed to have an atomic bomb at home. Signed the Tea Party, The NRA, and the Red Necks of America.

The lesson to be learned: America if you want to pass gun legislation you need to address the high level of illiteracy and ignorance in the USA. It is well known that a good many americans are unable to find their own country on the map. Many of them believe that the USA has boundaries with two countries: south of the border is the country of Africa and north of the Border is Russia. And Mexico is part of New Mexico. The question is: should someone who is incapable of finding the USA in the map be allowed to own a gun? The answer is NO!!!

==================================

Here is the Stone Cold reality the GOP faces:

Obama for four more years.

Hillary for eight years.

By 2024 50% of the GOP will be dead or in nursing homes.

Democrats will be getting stronger every year.

And even Texas will go Blue by 2030 or earlier. It is already OVER Conservatives. It is all just a matter of time.

    "only a matter of time" when the whole country is on welfare, thanks to all the stupid idiots who voted for obozo.
==================================

Vary offensive he talks down to Americans by addressing our city leaders to push us. He said over and over, "tell them.......". He's just drawing more lines trying to divide Americans so he can push HIS will on us!
==================================

    Yeah, urging citizens to make their voices known to their elected officials sure sounds like imposing his will ... NOT.

    Regulating the out of control gun availablity saves kids lives. Period.

    That is it, not worrying about some black helicopter.
==================================

The process of determining the reach of the 2d Amendment has just begun.

Prohibitions based on a classification, such as "assault weapon," with no showing of a distinguishing public safety characteristic probably would violate the 2d Amendment.

It will be necessary to establish that a semi-automatic "assault weapon" poses a greater public safety risk than other semi-automatic rifles that are not classified as "assault weapons." Otherwise, the classification is arbitrary.

For example, does a pistol grip render an "assault weapon" more lethal than a semi-automatic rifle that does not have a pistol grip?

The same is true of other proposed prohibitions, including so-called high-capacity magazines. What is the characteristic of a 12-round magazine that renders it a safety risk greater than a 10-round magazine, sufficient to warrant the separate classification?

The Heller decision turned on handguns, which the Court found were popular and appropriate choices for self-defense. In a case arising from a national magazine ban, would the Court be likely to decide that handguns with 12-round magazines could be banned while those with 10-round magazines could not?

The Heller decision recognized that militia and self-defense are the twin pillars of 2d Amendment protection. Therefore, can firearms that are used for sporting purposes, such as hunting or target shooting, be banned?

Would the Court be likely to find that rifles can be prohibited because they are not as readily deployed as handguns for self defense? Will the Court employ a test to gauge a firearm's utility for self defense?

These issues and more will not be resolved in the first case to reach the Supreme Court following any legislative prohibition on firearms.

==================================

Obama can give people more, we need to have money to work. With out there is no money. Giving us money to spend helps keep the poor working by buying things they never would have bought unless they were giving a chance. so keep on Giving And God will give you ten times what you gave. So give already. We need Christ help here!

We have a gun for every citizen. More guns then any other nation in the world and more murders then any other. Congrats by the way.. And obviously from those stats more guns and doing nothing are not the answer. As for Chicago, its a perfect example as to why more guns are not the answer. As for them protecting you, more the half the gun shot victims on the south side were carrying.

Guns don't kill black people, other blacks do..http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-n...

Posted on 2/4/2013 4:41:03 PM by grundle

The NAACP's ludicrous idea to sue gun manufacturers is yet another attempt by the left to avoid personal responsibility for some individuals' bad behavior.

When the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People announced plans recently to file an injunctive class-action suit “to force [gun manufacturers] to distribute their product responsibly," the NAACP president, Kweisi Mfume, noted that gun violence takes a disproportionately high toll among young black males........So I did a bit of math with the crime stats from the FBI (2010 UCR reporting) and some census data (again 2010)....good article on freerepublic...basically get the police in there and start arresting the gang banging drug dealing, babies daddies..

So here's the numbers, like them or not.

1) 50% of all murder victims in 2011 were African-American.
2) 52 % of all murderers in 2011 were African-American (if their race was known and a significant fraction was unknown).
3) The murder rate (not including manslaughter) in the US in 2011 (4.1 per 100K) is half what it was in 1992, and the rate has been falling since 1992, its not an all at once thing.
4) Given that African-Americans make up 14% of the US population and commit half of all murders, that implies…
a) The murder rate for non-African-Americans (86% of the US population) is something like half the national average (about 2.3/100K) – about the same as that of Finland.
b) The murder rate for African-Americans is about 15/100K - roundly the same as the murder rate in Mexico.
c) African-American men ages 13-39 are about 2.4% of the population of the US in 2011 and account for an estimated 40% of all murders.
5) About half of all murders in the US are committed with handguns (again, as of 2011).

Conclusion: Unless and until we control young urban Black males killing other young urban Black males we're not going to significantly reduce murder rates in the US.

Opinion: Americans don't believe giving up their fundamental right to armed self-defense is a price worth paying to stop street thugs engaged in the narcotics trade from killing each other at a high rate.

Simply stated he is going to control gun violence by making all the legal law abiding gun owners pass a background check. Yup there is some common sense in that one for sure. How does this guy make it to work in the morning?

Once again the writer did not include the exact words of Obama, " we do not need our citizens to have more firepower than the police" I do believe and I am guessing that is why the second ammendment is in the Constitution.

    The New York Times onWhy the AR-15 is most-wanted gun in America
    'It's kind of fashionable ... the young generation likes them, the assault-looking guns'
    http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5068...

    “The AR-15, it's kind of fashionable," says Frank Loane Sr., the proprietor. His shop has a revolving waiting list for the rifles, and a handful of people are now on it. “The young generation likes them, the assault-looking guns."
    By now, many Americans probably recognize the AR-15, whether or not they recognize the term. Unlike its military counterpart, the M-16, the civilian AR-15 cannot spray a continuous stream of ammunition with one pull of the trigger. But, as a semiautomatic, it can fire individual bullets as fast as the trigger can be squeezed.

Contrary to what many people believe, having a gun in your home doesn't
make you safer but instead endangers you and your loved ones. A gun in
the home makes the likelihood of homicide three times higher, suicide
three to five times higher, and accidental death four times higher. For
every time a gun in the home injures or kills in self-defense, there are
11 completed and attempted gun suicides, seven criminal assaults and homicides with a gun, and four unintentional shooting deaths or
injuries.

==================================

    b.s....old statistics and odd ratios from the mid 90s using questionable samples and methodology. They basically underestimate the data from households with guns where nothing happens (the other 99.99999% of the population), while oversampling the rare "adverse" events.

    besides, we live bathed in all sort of risks: a bathtub in your home increases the chances of you drowning in it by definition. But we don't give up bathtubs for showers. We live with the risk, because the risk is overall low compared to other causes of death.
==================================

    Lost in space are you little one. No wonder your mother keeps you in the basement with the doors locked. ALLONS
==================================

    I'm sorry but those statistics can be countered in many, many ways and your numbers smack of being compiled by one of the usual anti-gun suspects. They go way against the life experience of people who live in heavily armed communities. If nothing else a person should have the choice as to whether or not they wish to be armed. And it's nobodies business what choice they make. It's called being a "free" people.

I think it is hilarious when the right wing gets all puffed up about their guns.

For example, the right-wing “militias" and “minutemen" are nothing but civilian organizations largely comprised of wannabe commandos, skin-heads and dipsh!t law-and-order types who join up for the paramilitary vibes, the testosterone-rich conviviality of meetings with other faux servicemen, and the patches and hats they get to wear.

==================================

        I guess if Obama is the ringmaster, that leaves all Republicans as the circus clowns and animals...
==================================

"“You can't count on anything in Washington until it's done, and nothing's done yet."

Sounds just like his economic plan

==================================

He thinks hes a ABE Lincoln clone.

All hat and no cowboy.

If I had a job,I might could buy me a weapon.

Now its just pinto beans. W

Want GAS? Eat beans.

==================================

    okie, it's time to get up and off your urine-soaked couch in that dilapidated shed you call home in the Ozarks and learn some grammar. Also, your moonshine distillery is overheating!
==================================

    No, no, no. These days he's Eisenhower. He was Lincoln last month.

    Just as long as he doesn't try to be FDR again, we'll be safe.
==================================

Did he make a "call to arms" speech, or a "you must surrender your arms" speech. No matter what he said or did not say, all Paul Revere's should be saddling up and preparing for a ride.
==================================

"On the road again -
Just can't wait to get on the road again."
Why can't this tool stay home and fix something that's broke? Like the econ,my.

==================================

Fiscal cliff proposal - Hollywood and Nascar got $$$. Did that save or add jobs?

Just think: the INTEREST we pay on our debt is a trillion $. That's a trillion $ pissed into the wind.

Just think: If instead that money could be spent on: maintaining our infrastructure, we have places like: "Hannford Nuclear facility" that could leak and destroy all nearby water in WA; maybe we could even continue our space program! Oh the things we could do, if we would only budget the trillions of tax $$ people pay?

==================================

We have good laws on the books: background checks, criminals who commit crimes with guns, illegal immigration, etc.; allow them to be enforced. It's only due to lib, bleeding hearts, soft on crime, that don't want to punish the guilty. If any criminal using a gun in a crime would AUTOMATICALLY get the maximum sentence, or no plea bargaining to lesser offense, or whatever - which is the direct result of lib lawyers - gun crime would be much lower than it is.

Really cracking down on "DUI" fines and penalties, has greatly decreased the number breaking that law. It's only when they once again start getting soft on this penalties - have they gone back up. Simple - you wish to stop criminal activity - penalize the criminals!!!!

==================================

Obama you're on the road to nowhere and you are taking the rest of us with you

==================================

How about you, Obama, and the Dems/libs concentrate on those things the government is enpowered, by the Constitution, supposed to be doing at this time? You know, like submitting a budget, like going through our long list of spending - which is really long totalling 16 trillion $$ - in order to actually improve jobs and our economy - which our voters have entrusted you to do.

Maybe it's just me; but I do not look to our politicians to solve all of our problems, especially when simply passing another law that our politicians will not follow or enforce - is not the solution.

==================================

Obama takes yet one more message on the road. Does that say something about his home life that evidently he cannot stand for more than one Super Bowl party at a time?

==================================

"Obama takes gun debate on the road: 'It's time to do something"
How about a picture of you shooting a semi-automatic handgun to show us all that you care?

==================================

Comrade Obama, you and your administration lies whenever and
wherever you need to to move forth your agenda. Were you able, you would purge the US of guns… every last gun in the country, if you could. So please forgive Wayne LaPierre and those of us who don't trust you as far as we can spit. You're a dishonest lot, motivated by a distorted worldview. If mass murder prevention were truly your goal, you would welcome armed security wherever needed. It is outrageous that we protect our money with far more firepower than we protect our children.
==================================

Black unemployment=23% Do you think the media would be ok with this if a evil republican were president?
==================================

Damn right.

It is time for the President his friends to quit taking money from the biggest profiteers from gun violence.

That would be the makers of violent video games--and their junior partners in the Hollywood movie business.

==================================

Yes it is, here's a hint try: focusing on the economy since it effects the whole country (versus the less then a tenth of a percent your running your mouth about).

Obama, we get your an idiot, gun control is still above your head.
I know the low hanging fruit is how a guy like you gets through life (it's much easier then hard things like that require math). but still, you should try to focus on the economy.

Although your base is a bunch of morons, the other half of the country still remember all those nice job and economic speeches you gave as you were lying your way into a second term.
==================================

3000 gallons of jet fuel-Check
Load the teleprompter-Check
Find some drones for a photo-op backdrop-check
Be prepared with straw man arguments-check
Bill taxpayers for 2 million for trip to Minnesota.-check

==================================

So how much money did that trip cost? Minneapolis is a liberal enclave so the only reason to make the trip was to give the illusion he has massive support for his gun grab. Has this guy ever heard of a phone or visual office or heck, he can use one of his free Obama phones.

==================================

    He used the "virtual" signature for signing the fiscal cliff agreement. I think he has plenty of staff to help him "make a call". He's all into propaganda.
==================================

Obummer is freakin' idiot. Pass a budget stupid mutha fauker!
==================================

Uh-Oh!

A headline with the words "Obama" and "gun."

This'll bring out the paranoid crackpots.

==================================

WIll Obama pass a background check? His Aunt Zeituni and Uncle Omar failed.

==================================

Do you want to hear something really depressing? We have to endure four more years of this ass clown.

==================================

    yeah, how'd that happen again?
==================================

If we didn't have these automatic cars, and the keys were safely locked in a cabinet.....this wouldn't be such problem in America.

==================================

Time to start respecting the constitution.

==================================

Time to stop putting future generations into debt. Time to stop killing jobs. Time to pass a budget. Time to get out of our lives.

==================================

I think the president should more thoroughly examine his own house - 300K hollow-point bullets purchased by the SS administration, 7K "assault weapons" on order by the Dept of Homeland Security for "personal defense", not to mention, of course, the "Fast and Furious" debaucle.

==================================

    They are going to use those weapons on American citizens!! He's keeping Military leaders willing to shoot us and dismissing those that won't!!!
==================================

yeah

time to repeal the HIPPA laws and start committing people like Adam Lanza, Jared Loughner, the Aurora shooter, the Virginia Tech shooter, and on and on.

time to prosecute criminals who commit crimes with guns

time to fire Eric Holder for giving Milwaukee's criminal element machine guns and head gear

time to stop playing games and be a leader

==================================

Lets just take the Democrats guns away.....since they are the enemy
==================================

OBAMA - an ineffective leader who Campaigned for 8 years. When all else fails - Campaign.

==================================

"It's time to do something." That's right, just do something, or anything. Whether it fixes the problem or not, doesn't matter.
Another example the intellectual laziness of the liberal mind.

==================================

https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net...

==================================

Nothing but distractions. Where are all the liberal blacks who scream for equality these days? Total silence. Where are all the screams for jobs for the masses? Total silence. Then all the screams for total government controls. Deafening and resounding. Why? Who is it who wants everyone silent and the government coming down totally? I don't.

==================================

Leftist for "do something" means "weaken the opposition".

==================================

Time for a new president, then anything else. The next time, get one that follows laws himself and sets good examples.

==================================

I guess he won`t like my assault bike then.

==================================

    LMAO! But are Mini-Guns considered automatic weapons? This could be legal.
==================================

Empty appeal, Empty rhetoric.Mental illness is the problem, not guns.
==================================

The purpose of the 2d Amendment is to guarantee that Americans can bear arms, and serve in a militia, in self defense.

James Madison wrote in 1788 in Federalist No. 26, that the proposed new Constitution of the United States, would allow citizens to bear arms to fight even the standing army of the national government:

"Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal
government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. . . . Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of."

Madison was the primary draftsman and proponent of the Constitution under which we now live. He and most of his colleagues assumed that, one day, the national government would turn on its citizens and that they would need their arms to protect themselves.

==================================

    And Thus They Did.
==================================

Jared Loughner passed a background check. So did Seung Hui-Cho. So did Nancy Lanza. A lot of good that did. Liberals find something that doesn't work and double down on it

==================================

    they passed them because of the HIPPA laws
    the same liberals who want your guns confiscated also protect the privacy of violent mentally disturbed people because every one knows their right to privacy is more important than public safety
    another turd from Clinton, like the wall between the intelligence agencies that brought us 9/11
==================================

Yup spending more tax dollars pushing an agenda we don't want, won't follow and won't work. Meanwhile back at the ranch the issues and attention that is of the utmost urgency remains neglected. Go look at the available NY film footage basically the attending public saying the government is corrupt go back and tell them to repeal the law... oh and how much are the fines because any nincompoop knows first comes registration, then comes confiscation. Pretty powerful stuff.

==================================

Why does the President continue to spend large amounts of money to travel here and fro to talk about issues? He actually has facilities available to him in DC. Is there one particular reason he is unable to stay where his office is?

==================================

It's time to do something... about jobs, about negative economic growth, about a healthcare bill that will totally bankrupt our great country, about making this country energy independent using our own natural resources-oil, coal, and natural gas. Go sit at your desk Zero and do the job you were elected to do.

==================================

So a couple thousand killings per year with guns... OK, fine... How many citizens will be killed or suicide when the financial system collapse and most folks (non elites) are reduced to mere slaves once again? How many are going to go after the elites with their guns and exact revenge? is that maybe what they are attempting to avoid in the future?

==================================

"We don't have to agree on everything"...On this issue I don't agree with anything this marxist wants/says/thinks/does.
==================================

to quote Joe Biden, "Two Words, Chi Cago"

==================================

What is with this clown ? The campaign is over, no need to continue except to suck up per diem for his lazy staff. This guy is the worst. The nation is a disaster and he's boondoggling, wasting taxes and living it up. A true elite liberal.

==================================

110 people died in homicides involving assault weapons last year. 100 died choking on lollipops. How long are we going to tolerate these assault lollipops killing our kids?

==================================

Perhaps they can have a children's choir sing America the Beautiful before the next fiscal cliff.......or a group of homeless people.

They don't believe in gun rights, they believe in gun LIES
Obama arms the cartel with assault weapons, Coverup and LIES
http://youtu.be/M6zjvw4PfAU

All Leftists LIE about guns

==================================

I'm surprised he didn't give the speech holding a teddy bear from one of the Sandy Hook kids.....he missed that one.

==================================

Why does Obama have to travel daily on Air force One to give a speech, it cost a lot of money to fly a 747 boeing aircraft. We have Television, he has his own movie making company, there is phone conferencing. He could of used any one of these. Less face it Obama is on TV weekly so why fly around daily. He has done this since taking office so how much do you think this has cost us, go ahead and guess millions or billions. Remember it take two or three 747 boeing planes to carry his cars and security vans, several airforce f-16 fighter place and hundreds of security personal plus the cost of payments to his props that back him up. So tell me why is all the necessary, no other president has done all this flying and giving of speeches and wasting tax payers money.

==================================

    oh, come on.... the deficit last year was only 1 trillion dollars... i got that in my right front pocket....
==================================

let's do something not the right thing just something.Sounds like the democrat platform.

==================================

Maybe we can make a law that forces everyone to chew their food 100 times for meat, and 50 times for vegitable, i mean if it only saves one life, right?

==================================

    What about only one square of toilet paper at a time, if it only saves one tree?
==================================

    dont remind them we get meat.... bloomberg will take that away from us....
==================================

...and coming up with a budget... and a FEW MILLION JOBS (remember "focus like a laser"?).

==================================

    Been out of work since June '12 & after numerous interviews nothing at all.
==================================

        im sorry to hear that..... keep your spirits up and keep networking....
==================================

See the movie "End Of Watch' and you tell me if you want what Obama wants? For the umpteenth time it is not the LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS WHO ARE KILLING PEOPLE!!

OBAMA: YOU EFING MORON!!

==================================

Do "something"? OK. Fine. I want a suppressed, select fire, submachine gun. An H&K MP-5 will do just fine. Thank you.

==================================

    Great selection, I love mine!
==================================

Time to act before we know what we're doing? Hmmm, where was that kind of decisiveness in Benghazi? Oh, too busy waiting on more intelligence on that one...too damn bad for the ambassador and the Seals. You could have saved 4 lives then, Mr. President. But I guess they don't count. Wouldn't be "shooting from the hip" like you accused Romney of doing, would you?? Acting first, thinking later??

==================================

It IS time to do something. IMPEACH oBAMA!!

Where is this azzholes budget!! This just proves that Obama could care less about our economy.

    Notice somthing about these shootings that stands out other than the shootings themselves? I noticed right away that almost EVERY one of these shootings happened in BLUE cities.... Now if we follow the logic thet "if we only save one life" then why dont we ban cars, knives, shiny pointy things, oh and eating, since someone may choke on their food, mayebe we can make a law that forces everyone to chew their food 100 times for meat, and 50 times for vegitable, i mean if it only saes one life, right?
==================================

    so tell me in which one of these cases was the criminals first criminal act not obtaining the weapon used.
==================================

'It's time to do something'
.
Deport Obama !
==================================

“That's common sense," he said. “There's no reason we can't get that done. That is not a liberal idea or a conservative idea. It's not a Democratic or Republican idea. That is a smart idea." Is Obama saying that smart ideas don't come from either party? He actually included the Liberals in this disclaimer!
==================================

"It's time to do something"? Most Americans want our problems solved not knee jerk reactions that don't solve the problem. As VP biden stated last week ""Nothing we are going to do is fundamentally going to alter or eliminate the possibility of another mass shooting or guarantee that we will bring gun deaths down." For once I agree with Joe. According to FBI stats the ban on assulat weapons had no measurable effect on crime. It is this violent culture that's the problem not the guns. Until the problem of our violent culture is dealt with we will still continue to have murders no matter what you ban.
==================================

    No, the problem is not "violent culture" the problem is Big Pharma pushing SSRI drugs to people with problems... Have you seen the side effects to those meds? That is the ONLY link besides guns with almost every mass shooter in recent history.
==================================

        But there continues to be diversion to this fact. Because it does not fit with this very old agenda.
==================================

How about you concentrate on running the country instead of being the quintessential community agitator?
You sicken me.

==================================

    at least he is doing what he knows... thank goodness he previously wasnt a male stripper or male masseuse....
==================================

        Check out , "The Down Low Club", he was more than a stripper!!!
==================================

This issue is simply an opportunity for the President to get away from Mooch and run around the country to divert the public from his dismal failure as a leader in job growth and the economy.

==================================

Just another day in the U.S. with a failed president who uses children for propaganda to further his political agenda while he perpetuates his gun LIES. Deflect, distract and disinform.

Obama lies about guns Fast and Furiously.

Barack Obama Exploits the Sandy Hook Shooting
http://youtu.be/M6zjvw4PfAU?hd...

==================================

    He really cares about our kids, that's why he believes in murdering them as they are being born!!
==================================

    I applaud you thinking. Why doesn't Obama worry about what the kids will have to cough up out of the pay checks when they get in their 40's-5o's. Reid will drag this out for ever as he is seeking re-election in a very gun pro state. So, basically Obama is dooming Reid's chances of re-election. Finally Obama is doing something good. Remember Reid voted no on the first gun ban
==================================

Ah yes, the timeless lament of the political left: "DO SOMETHING!! Even if it's useless, wrong, misguided and will do nothing to actually address the problem!" Although truthfully and sadly, it's not just the left.

==================================

    Useless wrong and misguided is the motto of the left.

    As Fernando (Billy Crystal) on SNL would say its not how you look but how you feel--- libs lead by emotion which is always a wrong appraoch to any sensible solution
==================================

    Also a rant from the Left is "We have to make sure this never happens again!" Hold on to your wallet and your rights when ever you hear a Lib say those words.
==================================

        And of course "Think of the children".
==================================

        Another phrase is what Obama uttered today: "if there's one life we can save, we've got an obligation to try."

        I don't think he was talking about abortion.
==================================

            Or banning cars, knives, hammers, food (since people choke), cigaretts, or any other arbitrary "thing" that people do, or use that may or may not hurt anyone.... Im surprised they havent put a mandatory minimum number of times you have to chew your food before swallowing.
==================================

                I believe it has been determined to be approximately 10-15, and I am not kidding you. Someone help me out who is a good internet searcher. Some years ago some universit had grant money, did a study, and came up with good number of times to chew food for digestion, eating less, etc. Aunti kids you not.
==================================

                >>> Im surprised they havent put a mandatory minimum number of times you have to chew your food before swallowing. <<<

                18.
==================================

                    See my reply to emassee.
==================================

OK. Let's talk about "universal background checks". How, exactly, is that to be implemented? Does that mean universal registration? It would seem to me to be almost mandatory. And we're not going to register anything. Ever.

==================================

    I have a Sear & Roebuck JC Higgins shotgun, and a Excam .22 revolver that I'll register. I'm afraid to shoot them.
==================================

    It will be like illegal aliens willingly registering when they cross the boarder.

    In other words, it ain't gonna happen.

    Guns Don't Even Make The Top Ten List Of Big Killers

    The national debate on guns and gun control heat up every time there is a mass murder, but how many people even know what the rates are and just how many people die due to causes in other ways that have substantially huge numbers compared to the use of guns? This is one question that few seem to bring into view and even fewer wish to discuss because than it shows that guns are number ten in the top ten ways of killers in the United States. But if these statistics would show the murder of 4,000 babies a day in their mother's womb at the hands of paid hit men, then guns would not make it into the top ten of the “big killers" in the USA as shown by statistics given by Centers for Disease Control, FBI, and the United States Federal Government. By the way, over 1 year, more babies are murdered than any other source of killings and an abortion, though now legal, is a murder of an innocent child that has no way of knowing their life will be snuffed out by a doctor with a device. Babies have heartbeats at 4 days and an abortion stops that heartbeat, thus killing that baby.

    Perhaps the best way to see just how restricting the rights to own guns can be found by looking back in history to the most despicable regime in history, and that would be the Third Reich or better known as Nazi Germany with their leader, Adolf Hitler, the mad man of Germany! The following history can be found at Stephen Halbrook's website.

    This is from “17 Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law, No. 3, 483-535(2000)." In the first paragraph Halbrook shows a brief from Justice Felix Frankfurter that states:

    “We are in the danger of forgetting that the Bill of Rights reflects experience with police excesses. It is not only under Nazi rule that police excesses are inimical; to freedom. It is easy to make light of insistence on scrupulous regard for the safeguards of civil liberties when invoked on behalf of the unworthy. It is too easy. History bears testimony that by such disregard are the rights of liberty extinguished, heedlessly at first, then stealthily, and brazenly in the end." ( Davis v United States, 328 U.S. 582, 597 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., Dissenting)"
    What did Justice Frankfurter mean way back in 1946? It is simple. By all definitions, he meant that when gun control begins, it starts out small, then expands into further restrictions until in the end the government has extinguished all rights to gun ownership as did Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party of Germany.

    But the question becomes one of what to do with these mad, crazy people that commit these atrocious mass killings? How do we stop the gun violence? Both very good questions, but they do not address the symptom, only the result. The symptom of all the mass murders seem to be a problem with our ability to see this begin with a person's mental state. The mass murder at Fort Hood was done by a man whom the Army had known to have made strange statements about Islam and the Muslim people and they failed to act upon what they knew costing a number of injured and dead. The case in Colorado seems to indicate that those who did the mass shootings had made statements that the mental state of James Holmes should have red flagged authorities. Instead, they ignored those cases and they became surprised at what happened.

    In the most recent one in Newtown, Connecticut, this individual had made statements and was about to be committed, but the mental health system failed to stop a mad man and 27 lives were lost due to this, even with very tight gun controls and limited access into the building! Instead of looking at the source of these problems, those whom are determined to destroy the Constitution are looking at the results!

==================================

    Do you even look at these stories you cite? Do you realize how many involve dirtballs, gangbangers and various assorted and sundry scumbags? And these stories are supposed to convince us that we should DISARM in face of such lunacy? You know, if you want to be so gutless as to refuse to defend yourself from these buttwipes, go right ahead. But millions of us are quite convinced of our natural born right to defend ourselves from these scum and as to your leftist gungrabbing attempts, WE WILL NOT COMPLY.
==================================

    About 110 people also died today in car accidents.
==================================

    I didn't read every one but I'll accept it at face value. So what? Tragedies all I'm sure but how many of those crimes were committed with legally purchased "assault weapons" by people who would be stopped by anything in any of these most recent proposals from the left side of Washington? I'd venture less than 5% if that much. You can't solve the problem if you refuse to even accurately define it.
==================================

    2700 abortions were performed in the United States today. All of them resulted in a death.
==================================

    Not a single example of an "assault weapon" and absolutely nothing new legislation would do to prevent a single one of these incidents. What the hell is your point? Oh yea, i like how you through a stabbing in there as well, banning knives these days?

==================================

        So therefore, the fix for crime is to restrict law-abiding, decent citizens who AREN't breaking the law.

        That'll simplify the problem immensely for the criminals.

        Again. SO WHAT? refer to my above comment. I can produce a list of murders not involving firearms if you like. Baseball bats are #1 Do we ban baseball bats? Your argument is emotional not logical. It's useless.

Say NO to unconstitutional and abjectly unfair Universal Background checks:
We've already ceded enough of our rights to the gun grabbers; it's time to say NO MORE!

    The Gun Control Debate
    http://jpfo.org/articles-assd0...

    Background checks are a placebo, a useless "feel good" drug, to placate the citizens, and make them think that we are prohibiting criminals and lunatics from getting guns. People in their right minds, understand that criminals do not obey laws, ergo the designation, "criminal".

    What folks who are not part of the gun culture do not realize, is that registration is the holy grail of gun control. Once you have all guns registered, you can control them. If a significant number of the guns in a society are not known, they cannot be controlled. The same is true of ammunition. Own a list of the people who have it, and you own the people's behavior. It's that simple.

    One of the most important things we could do as Americans in terms of staying free, is making sure that government does NOT know who is armed, and with what they are armed.

==================================

Since he doesn't know how to lead or confer with Members of Congress to find solutions, he'll just keep on campaigning and reading speeches from his teleprompter.

==================================

Obama is correct, it is time to do something. The way to fix this problem is through prosperity. Poverty has a way of turning citizens into law breakers. Prosperity on the other hand pacifies citizens, they have no need to break the law with the exception of drugs. Further low unemployment has a tendency to lower crime rates as well. The first thing Obama should do is focus like a laser on jobs. Secondly, reduce regulations on businesses, and thirdly allow the pipeline, and allow energy companies to drill and frack us back to prosperity. Other wise, the foolish child is just wizzing into the wind.
==================================

"I'm going to focus like a laser on jobs". Barack Obama

    right after we have an interview with Steve Croft an hour before the Sandy Hook choir sings America the Beautiful at the Super Bowl...... and I follow up with a speech to police on Monday....what timing!

Translation: Don't expect anything to change even though I've done my level best to destroy the right of self-defense THIS time.

Obama: Gun Control Is Not a 'Perfect Solution'
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...
==================================

    47% of America flips this guy the bird! I would really appreciate if somebody showed up with a bull horn and cursed this traitor out. Our frustration with the corruption and blatant lies is getting intolerable.
==================================

        I see part of the problem being their blatant use of LIES and basing their agenda on these lies.

        The corrupt Bull Stream Media certainly won't call him out on these lies and falsehoods ad was intended by the founding fathers.

        So the only voice from the wideness are a few uncorrupted media sources, bloggers and average citizens resisting the lies – I'm afraid the regime won't want to abide the right of free-speech much longer and soon try to oppress that liberty as well as the liberty of self-defense.
==================================

No disrespect POTUS but stay away from infringement of my God given right and please deal with the debt. They tried this in Chicago years ago and the city has the highest homicide rate in the country. Read the report on gun control written by the Congressional Research and pass on to all those have not read it.

==================================

    No disrespect? Nothing but disrespect for this guy. The more you know, the worse it gets.
==================================

Hey Obama, how about putting this kind of attention towards our national debt, unemployment, budget, sequestration or immigration. Your priorities are way off base man!

==================================

    Now that he can't get re-elected, he has no theme or focus for his administration.
==================================

    Where is the 2 week Biden task force for unemployment?
==================================

I am all for banning firearms from criminals. Here is a novel idea, if you use a gun against others that is not deemed self defense then you get life. Let's not ban weapons from law abiding citizens, which is what the gun control fanatics are advocating. In other words, they don't want you to be able to defend yourselves, except with scissors or a knife, according to the Director of Homeland Security. In other words, the government doesn't want you to kill criminals. They would rather prefer you not defend yourselves and let the criminals kill you. After all, look at all those smart people who run Chicago. They say they don't want you to have a gun and Chicago is basically a gun-free zone, so law abiding citizens are unable to defend themselves. Well, the criminal element in Chicago has declared open season on fellow

Chicagoans, thus the murder rate there is higher than it is in Afghanistan. Obviously, the criminals in Chicago did not get the message that they are not suppose to own a gun there. How profoundly stupid and idiotic these gun control liberal pacifists are. Maybe their position for gun control supports their long held positions on population control. Yeah, that must be it. They just want most people to die, so they would not have to worry about over population and global warming any more.

==================================

What we need to do is make sure that every member of congress understands that this issue is a loser. That if this silliness becomes law in any form the Democrats will lose the Senate in '14 and that the house will be even more Republican. With a little luck this will be "Obama's "pride cometh before a fall" moment.

==================================

    if it becomes law there will be hundreds of thousands of new criminals.
==================================

none of these murders were committed by an individual possessing the weapon legally in the first place. are they that stupid?
==================================

    And the latest example that they are hanging all this public opinion on shows the AR wasn't even found in the building. Several retractions aired once, then pulled. And our two leaders again go off running on misinformation and conjecture. But they know how to fix this issue. (Yea right) Its all deflection and it is a transparent as it gets.
==================================

        Reagan said, "it's not that are liberal friends are ignorant, it's just that so much of what they know just isn't so."
==================================

            “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron." ~ President Dwight Eisenhower
==================================

                Relevance?
==================================

            if you subscribe to reagan's opinions, then here's one for you to consider: http://www.snopes.com/politics... be sure to scroll down to the letter he signed with ford and carter.
==================================

                It was a judgement, not an opinion.

                Learn the difference so you won't mouth off without knowing what you're talking about next time.
==================================

                Ah, jb....bill1967 and gang will not be able to understand what Reagan or Eisenhower meant. Way too much processing for them.
==================================

                    Talking about people is a diversion, Jane.
                    Do you want to appear dishonest and wrong?

                    People who know what they are talking about and who have an HONEST disagreement stick to the point instead of talking shi+ about people.
==================================

                You learn that one from Piers Morgan? Just because a person likes Reagan doesn't they have to agree with everything he ever said. Besides, by the time he "signed" that letter in favor of gun control, he was not in full possession of his senses. The Bradys probably prevailed upon Nancy to have Ron "sign" that letter.
==================================

                not only did he support the "assault riffle" ban, he actively lobbied congress to pass it. in the end they say his support was the most influential aspect in the bill passing. just because i subscribe to most of what Reagan stood for, including the The Firearm Owners' Protection Act does not mean i agree with everything. namely the Brady bill and his support on "assault weapons ban". we do now know however the "assault weapons" ban was an utter failure and did nothing but infringe on law abiding citizen 2nd amendment rights, the same as far as the Brady bill goes.
                here are some stats for you and keep in mind these are the same laws Obama is purposing at the fed level.
                California scores no.1 for second year in a row on the Brady state scorecard with 81 points for strictest gun control laws. California also not only is no.1 in gun murders but 68% of all gun murders take place in California.
                gun control for law abiding citizen is a free pass for criminals and gun violence.
==================================

    Big yes on that one Bill.
==================================

    Yes they are stupid and want to stay that way.
==================================

    Yes, they are. At least the sheeple are, obama and knows exactly what he's doing.

Relax OB, most of the country is doing something. Its called IGNORING YOUR WHINING!!! WHERE IS YOUR BUDGET???

==================================

    They've been jaw-boning gun control for three weeks now. Do it, already. Draft it up and send it through the process.

    I'm tired of people piously and sanctimoniously urging "Do something!! Do something!!" to other people.

    Go ahead and "do something" yourself. Obama or anyone else can write out proposed or draft legislation, get supporters and co-sponsors on board, and send it on through.

    The Dems and libs seem to be very hot for gun control, yet they don't seem to be doing anything about it. You want gun control, git 'er done. Stop yelping like a stuck pig.

    BTW, Cuomo's hysterical gun control speech in NYC doesn't seem to have convinced many people. There is video out of a townhall meeting in western New York state where, um, a bunch of average looking citizens looked pretty peeved about it. Not Mississippi, but New York.
==================================

        Meanwhile, GDP is in negative territory and unemployment remains high. He ought to "do something" about promoting growth-related policies.

There's no reason in hell for assault weapons. But it's the right wing wacos that are the real danger.

==================================

    I suppose you'll dial 911 and wait on the police...............good for you, the world needs those people too.
==================================

    For the sake of whatever deity you worship! WTF is an assault weapon? You can't ban it if you can't clearly distinguish it.
==================================

    assault weapons are only found in the military and police. tony bacone your a bafoon just like obama
==================================

    Your reasoning is based on your not ever owning one or even learning what exactly what an assault weapon is. Notice I'm not name calling to debate my point. Please read the report just finished by the Congressional Research and come back as an informed person with data to prove your logic.
==================================

    As opposed to the left wing Marxists who want to limit YOUR freedoms so long as it's not THEIR freedoms!
==================================

    What assault weapons? My AR is NOT an assault weapon! What country uses it in their military - NONE... The US ARMY defines an Assault rifle is a short rifle, mag fed and firing more than one round per trigger pull... so the US MIlitary defines a AR-15 as not an ASSAULT weapon... SO ITS NOT AN ASSAULT WEAPON! Nice try, please try again when the brain grows in... Actually the threat to the US today is the left wing loons, basically if your liberal, you despise the constitution and have surrended your citizenship. Leftists are more enemies than terrorists.... Seeing we like to define things, I define a liberal as enemy of the state...
==================================

        The military now refers to their weapons as personal defense weapons but when the civilian has a look a like version it's an assault weapon...
==================================

    Ignorance must be blissful in the left wing.
==================================

    You welfare sponges really do not count.
==================================

GUN RUNNING IS A BIG BUSINESS

CRIMINALS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR STUPID 'LAWS'

==================================

    So is this the argument for eliminating all laws. Gunrunning is easier if you can go to your neighboring state, and buy all the guns you want and bring them back to the city to sell. By your same logic, we shouldn't have laws against drug use or sale because the people that want to find it will find it anyway, so why make it harder for them.
==================================

    So right you are. And the DOJ liked the idea so much they started participating in doing exactly that. They just didn't think they would get caught.
==================================

It is time to do something. Something about cutting government spending.

==================================

    It is time to do something about increasing revenue, not cutting spending.

    Taxes are at a 50 year low. We all have to pay a little more. Clinton showed how and it worked. Bush cut and we collapsed.
==================================

        "Taxes are at a 50 year low."

        26% of GDP is the _opposite_ of an historic low.

        I recommend making true statements from now on. You'll not only be more persuasive, you'll appear less dumb.
==================================

        Feel free to send the IRS a donation. You will not however be able to raise taxes on those of us who already pay federal income taxes.

        On the bright side you have 47% of the population to tap.
==================================

    Okay, since government spending is down since Obama's been president, can we start talking about gun control now.
==================================

        Evidence?
==================================

            google it. (sorry, I always screw up links). spending is, in actual dollars, down since obama took office. spending per citizen has also dropped. the increase in the deficit is caused by revenues being lower because of unemployment. fox news won't tell you that.
==================================

    Be patient, government spending is about to be cut big-time (i.e. military spending)...
==================================

    OK. But what's that got to do with this article?

    Why don't you go find an article about the deficit to spew your rhetoric.
==================================

        But your whining about religion being boring was on topic? And his point about spending was "logic" the _oppsoite_ of "rhetoric"

        So your comment was not only irrelevant by your own standards, you made a false claim in the guise of an irrelevant whine.

        Perhaps you should just stfu instead of proving your country was named after you.
==================================

    Obama talking about "common sense" is like Obama talking about the budget. He doesn't know anything about either.
==================================

        so sick of hearing that oval office occupier spew his teleprompter speeches - it makes me think of Proverbs 6:16-19 - the six things the Lord hates...
==================================

            religion = boring
==================================

                Not as boring as your whining about it.

                No, seriously - ask around and then stfu if you don't like the topic
==================================

                Can't stand to watch him either, never know when flies are going to land on his face, or rats are going to run in front of him!!! LOL
==================================

                    The rats are following him.
==================================

                sorry darlin' that's not religion... religion = catholicism, lutheranism, buddhism, hinduism, etc, etc, etc...
==================================

            I agree, I can't stand to even hear his voice on the boob tube.
==================================

        obama knows as much about Common Sense as a dillanger knew about obeying the laws.
==================================

        Don't you think its an issue,when our own president cannot pass the background check to purchase a firearm? Should we not find out why?
==================================

            "Time to do something" ..what a laugh !

            The truth of the matter is we have a guy [Obama] who goes alarmist on issues, and then nothing follows by failed policies and unintended consequences...

            ..and the LSMedia is complicit in this strategy. Look no further than how they rallied behind an INCREASE in unemployment (up to 7.9%), but failed to follow-up on the massive upward revisions (read lies) to earlier reports !

            > The “war on jobs" has only resulted in a real unemployment rate >14%, longest recession in US since WWII, lowest number of new businesses since 1977.

            > The “war on guns" has only resulted in more guns being sold, thus manufactured.

            > The “war on healthcare for all" has only resulted in a program we can't afford, nor implement.

            > The “war on debt" did not cut our $10 trillion debt. Its $16 trillion going on $20 trillion...

            > The “war on fossil fuel" has resulted in a policy driven by the “green" alternate energy fairy who drives a Volt and lives in fantasyland.

            > The “war on women" has only resulted in more women worried about their family's future.

            > The “war on wars" via Obama's appeasement policy has only resulted in a less safe world.

            > The “war on illegal immigration" has been MIA and undermined by Obama's vote buying desires.

            > The “war on poverty" has cost trillions and created a more dependent society with >47 million on food stamps.

            The LSMedia is complicit in supporting this with their BS tsunami of propaganda to cover-up all the failed leftist ideas.

                This is a list invented in the damaged minds of the TeaPublicans.

                They are a spent force, and reading this idiotic list, we can see why.
==================================

                    The Tea Party is mopping up at the local and state level because it's obvious that the national scene has been infiltrated. Obama winning more than 100% of the vote in several counties convinced all the non-brain-dead voters that the national elections no longer represent the people.

                    Once the Tea Party has local and state governments steered right, they'll move on to dealing with the Leviathan, because the state governments are the only power left that can.
==================================

            It is time to do something. It is time for him to stop abridging my rights and the rights of 300 Million others because there are a dozen mentally unstable people who have abused that right.

            It is high time for some parenting in the poor communities. It is time to bring back the family unit. Stop rewarding children out of wedlock and start rewarding children from a home with a mother and father. Stop hindering us from disciplining our children and let us discipline them. Stop talking about taking our rights away and give us tools to succeed.

            Stop worrying about the Boy Scouts (a private organization) and start worrying about the Trillion dollar deficits that cannot be fixed with more taxes on the so called rich.

            Stop concerning yourself with the NFL rules and regulations and start concerning yourself with the 16Trillion dollar debt.
==================================

                obamas is as LYING scumbucket. It is time for him ot set his assssbutt down and throw the keys to Air Force One away and work instead ofrunning all over the country spending taxpayer dollars LYING to his parasiticf leeches and the taxpayers/citizens. We have had all of the trash talking from this low life scumbucket we can tolerate.
==================================

            He can't? Where did you hear that?
==================================

                It doesn't matter where he heard it; as Bishop Berkeley pointed out centuries ago (for the second time, Jane); asking about sources distracts from the relevant question; is the claim true?

                Why do you always want to avoid the relevant question, Jane? Is it because you know the correct answer isn't the one you prefer?
==================================

                support criminal background checks on anyone trying to buy a gun.
==================================

                    How?
==================================

                    If that is a question...YES!
==================================

                        Yhe DHS is stockpiling millions of weapons and ammo. Would you happen to know WHY?? they would need all of these weapons
==================================

                            Iana, my husband even purchased another box of ammo...not because we want to stockpile but because the price is increasing due to all the 'conspiracy theories' being circulated** by nutcases. Americans not thinking through the issues are their own worse enemies.

                            **More than likely, ORIGINATED by the NRA to increase their sales to make more money for the CEO and upper echelon. .

                            "In 2010 the NRA reported that it had 781 full time employees, 125,000 volunteers and generated revenues of $227.8 million.

                            "As for salaries, fifty-six people in the organization earned more than $100,000 in 2010—and 10 made more than $250,000. Lapierre does not top the list. Kayne B. Robinson, the executive director of general operations does. He was paid just over $1 million. Lapierre was second, pulling in $970,000 in reportable and estimated comp.

                            "Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the group's lobbying efforts, was third. He earned just over $666,000.

                                And by 'nice' I mean like the Old English "nyse" meaning 'fool' from the Latin "nix" meaning 'ignorant.'
==================================

                            Maybe there was a huge sale!!!

                            Do you know who the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Homeland Security is? IT is David Norquist, the brother of Grover No/rquist (assume you know him). David Norquist was appointed to CFO of DHS by GWB. Since he would have focus on all major purchases, does that mean that you are afraid of what the Republicans are doing?

                                Go to , " WND-Why is the Government stockpiling weapons". There is a video of O saying he wanted to create a Civilian National Security Force as big and as strong and as well funded as The Defense Dept.!! There's an articale too.
==================================

                                    Q: Is Obama planning a Gestapo-like "civilian national security force"?

                                    A: This false claim is a badly distorted version of Obama's call for doubling the Peace Corps, creating volunteer networks and increasing the size of the Foreign Service.

                                    (Factcheck.org)
==================================

                                        It's not a false claim. That's why he wants our guns so we can't defend ourselves against him. He is using those murdered kids to take our guns. If he really cares about kids, he wouldn't believe in murdering them as they are being born. That is heartless!
==================================

                                            oh, Iana, I asked you once if you finished high school. I believe you have answered my question. My husband and I have guns and no one is trying to take our guns..including Obama. Gee, go back to school, learn to think for yourself instead of some nut job telling you what to do and how to act.
==================================

                                                What does my education have to do with anything? O is not taking guns YET. This is the first step of confiscation. It has nothing to do with "caring" about kids being shot. Like I said, he wouldn't believe in murdering babies as they are being born, if he "cares" about kids!! Common sense should tell you that.
==================================

                                                    Iana, I found this letter to the editor in a local Virginia newspaper...Please read the excerpts I pulled and think about what the writer is pointing out; i.e., the absolute absurdity of citizens arming themselves against our government....

                                                    "The debate about guns has had surprising benefits. Until some representatives of the gun lobby spoke repeatedly on national TV, who would have thought that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to equip the people to fight an evil government?

                                                    We know that the government has nuclear weapons, tanks, artillery and planes. We now know that the people must be similarly armed.

                                                    So, as we account for each road and street, the first house selected must have a portable nuke. We know they're available - we fear terrorists have them. The second house must have a tank, together with massive magazines of ammo. We could drive them to the store!

                                                    Then, the third house will be supplied with an artillery piece, the fourth a bomber or fighter plane. So it would go, up and down each street and road. Without these weapons, the people might as well fight the government with BB guns.

                                                    Residents of condos and apartments would present an issue. But, with their ingenuity, these advocates will readily solve this little problem."

                                                    Does this letter not make to realize how ridiculous the NRA's propaganda really is?
==================================

                                                        Omuslim has given himself power to murder those who would stand in the way of sick agenda. Have you been reading about Navy Seals that have been murdered. I think 33 in 4 years. Ted Nugent will probably be next
==================================

                                                            22 Navy SEALs dead in Afghan chopper crash
                                                            Although Martin earlier reported that they were not members of SEAL Team 6, as some reports claimed, he is now reporting that It was Navy SEAL Team 6 but no members of bin Laden raid. The total of American dead appears to be 30, and we can say they came from the Navy, Air Force and Army, most of them Navy SEALs from Team 6. August 6, 2011

                                                            GWB was president when this war started...blame him. A total of 57 Navy SEALs have died since 9/11/2001.
==================================

                                                            And you are hearing this crap from whom? Ted Nugent?
==================================

                                                                Omuslim is taking out sharp shooters, Ted Nugent is close to one
==================================

                                                                    Okay...THAT is the dumbiest remark to date. I am getting bored with your ignorant remarks.
==================================

                                                                        We'll see, won't we. Omuslim is a murderer
==================================

                                                                Pat Dollard, check it out
==================================

                                                    Iana, Did you hear Obama say that he believes in "murdering babies"? I haven't.

                                                    The Supreme Court decided on January 22, 1973 (7-to-2 vote) in favor of Roe in the Roe vs Wade decision. The Court deemed abortion a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of strict scrutiny. Of the nine judges who made that decision, seven were nominated to the Supreme Court by Republican presidents and two by Democratic presidents. Of the two desending votes, one was a Republican nominee and was was a Democratic nominee.
==================================

                                                        Yes, Omuslim believes in murdering babies even as they are being born. And if they survive the abortion, they are not allowed any medical help. They are left to die. That's kid loving Omuslim. That was the worse thing the Supreme Court has ever done-saying it is legal to murder unborn babies. That's when America really started going downhill-no respect for human life
==================================

                                                            OMG! Obama did not make that ruling. The Supreme Court did.
==================================

                                                                Omuslim made it law in Chicago, no medical help if an aborted baby is alive!!
==================================

                                                    No, Iana, common sense would tell you that the NRA is pumping that propaganda out to US citizens for profit. As I posted before, my husband and I own guns; many of our friends and relatives have guns in their homes as well. We are not afraid the USG is coming for them....it is an NRA scare tactic to increase their sells....heard the old saying "make hay while the sunshine"?
                                                    .

                                                    According to the Better Business Bureau's web site (DOI 2004), the NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, received a yearly salary of $895,897. They also indicated that fundraising costs accounted for 46% of the contributions received. The NRA is a 501(c)(4) organization and indicated that the NRA's total income in 2004 was $205,402,491. Total NRA assets at the end of 2004 were $222,841,128. If LaPierre made that kind of money in 2004, can you imagine what his 2013 salary will be with gun sales increasing?

                                                    The NRA will be the first to tell the public that crime in America has decreased between 3 and 4.9 percent (depending on your news source) in the last year. True. But what they do not say is that crime has risen in 25 states (remarkably so in some); e.g. Wyoming, WV, Vermont, Utah, Tennessee, SC, Oregon, Oklahoma, ND, NC, NJ, NH, Nebraska, Massachusetts, Miss, Michigan, Kansas, Indiana, Arkansas, Colorado, etc. Propaganda being leveled at the American public is that the main problem is still the inner cities with all the druggies--however, the violence in California, WDC, and New York decreased between 2011-2012...even though, admittedly, still much too high. And, for the present, the druggies mostly fight among themselves.

                                                    The United States has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world — by far. And it has the highest rate of homicides among advanced countries. (Factcheck.org)

                                                    Supreme Court: 2008 Heller v DC

                                                    (2) Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller's holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.

==================================

                                Relevance?
==================================

                    We already do. obama 1,7 million guns stopped is nothing but a freaking LIE. Criminals don't buy guns and get their backgrounds checked el stupido
==================================

                Stupidity strikes again in the form of Jane....
==================================

                    Okay, Smart One...Where can I read the article that says Obama can't pass the background check to purchase a firearm. Or is that info just being passed around by some 'talking head'? My husband and I had no problem passing the background check to purchase a few.
==================================

                        Where can I read the results of that background check, Jane?

                        Are you the same Jane that evaded the exact same question on another thread?

                        If his records haven't been sealed, simply direct me to the place where I can learn his grades at Columbia.

                        This is now the FOURTH time you've been confronted on this same question.

                        Are you avoiding it because you have such a great answer?

                        No, you're clearly avoiding it because you lost the argument, so grow some honesty and face the facts; Obama's history has been hidden from public view.

                        If you grow some honest curiosity, you might decide to wonder why.
==================================

                        He has never been vetted. PERIOD
==================================

                            You mean nothing has been found to be wrong about him. He's been 'vetted' by you nut jobs since 2007.
==================================

                            Dumbest statement every posted. Every presidential candidate has to be vetted.
==================================

                                That was considerate of you to preface your post with a synopsis, but people can still their own judgments without your 'help.'

                                The history of Obama's escape from a complete vetting proved your claim wrong years before you wrote it.

                                Are you proud to be 5 years out of date? Or didn't you, like so many other times, happen to notice your oversight?

                                If O had been vetted, he wouldn't be President
==================================

                                    Oh come on now, Iana, think about what you posted!! As much as the Republicans want to find something on Obama to discredit him, they would not have allowed him to run for the Office of President without proper vetting.
==================================

                                        "They" who?
==================================

Maybe we should add criminal background checks for all people taking a women to Planned Parenthood and stop the sexual trafficking of innocent, young women.
It is time to do something.

==================================

    Omuslim is acting so outraged over those 20 kids being murdered, yet he believes in murdering babies as they are being born!!! Hypocrite, phony!! We wants our guns so we can't protect ourselves from him!!
==================================

Why is gun control the number 1 agenda for both parties? Because they do not want to face the reality of our suffocating deficit spending and debt. No budget again-where is the outrage by Republicans? There is none. Why are articles of impeachment not brought up against Reid and Obama for failing their Constitutional duties? Even if they cannot get voted on, it shows the continued incompetence of both!

==================================

    It is being used as distraction, as is immigration reform, in hopes the general public will not notice that the gang of 535 is non productive.
==================================

    For starters, Reid cannot be impeached.
==================================

        Umm, yes a Senator can be impeached. It's very rare, but it did happen once in 1798 with Senator William Blount.
==================================

            We'll soon see how they choose to toss NJ Senator Bob Menendez from the Senate.
==================================

            The impeachment charges against Blount were dismissed by the Senate for lack of jurisdiction, after the Senate followed the *proper* constitutional mechanism of holding its own proceedings and expelling him from the chamber. No member of Congress has been impeached since Blount, deferring instead to the common-sense reading of the Constitution, which is that each house has the prerogative of expelling its own members.
==================================

What a fraud obama is, he is just as bad as a person buying a gun illegally. obama is a liar, a fraud and a chip bucket of corruption. When is obama,schumer, et al going to be sued for the financial corruption of freddie-fannie.

==================================

Sandy Hook Dad tells politicians they can take gun from his cold dead hands.
