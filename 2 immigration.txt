Landscape shifts on immigration

A bipartisan group of senators on Monday said the political landscape for immigration reform has changed, boosting their hopes for passing a bill.

Recent elections have changed his party’s view on immigration, said Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who led an unsuccessful push to reform the nation’s immigration laws in 2006 and 2007.

McCain said his party’s leaders and strategists are convinced they need to agree to some measure of reform to boost the party’s image among Hispanic voters, who voted overwhelmingly for President president in November.

“As I’ve stated before, elections, elections,” said McCain, who along with four colleagues spoke out at a Monday afternoon Capitol Hill press conference about a set of bipartisan principles for reform they had released with three other senators a day earlier.

“The Republican Party is losing the support of our Hispanic citizens, and we realize there are many issues in which we think we are in agreement with our Hispanic citizens, but this is a pre-eminent issue for those citizens,” said McCain, his party’s standard-bearer in the 2008 presidential election.

“We cannot continue as a nation with 11 million people residing in the shadows, and we have to address the issue and it has to be done in a bipartisan fashion,” McCain said.

McCain's point was underscored by Sen. Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) participation in the bipartisan Senate group. Rubio is seen as a leading contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2016, and his endorsement of the proposals gives the group some cover from conservative criticism. 

The four principles unveiled late Sunday include granting temporary legal status and creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, increasing visas for skilled workers, establishing an employer verification program and setting up a guest-worker program for jobs that cannot be filled by American citizens.

They stem from negotiations Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Judiciary immigration subcommittee, kick-started with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) after the election. Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) have endorsed it.

“The public’s attitude has changed in four years,” said Schumer. “Now they much prefer a comprehensive solution including a path to citizenship as well as fixing the border and doing the things we talked about.

“The public is yearning for real change now,” he said.

The White House on Monday welcomed the principles, with press secretary Jay Carney describing the group's endorsement of a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants as "a big deal."

While Schumer and McCain said the landscape on immigration reform had shifted, signs of the difficult debate ahead appeared throughout the day.

Shortly after their press conference, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) criticized the Senate group’s proposal.

Sessions compared the latest framework to the 1986 immigration law that granted legal residency to millions of illegal immigrants with the pledge the nation’s borders would be secured.

“That was the promise that was made in 1986, when the bill did pass. But it did not fulfill its promise,” Sessions said. ??

“So once again, I think that we’re in a situation where the promise will be made, that people will be given immediate regularized status and they won’t be given full rights of citizenship until certain laws are enforced and don’t worry about it,” he added. “But questions do need to be asked, and we will ask those questions.”

Vitter said he is also skeptical of the bipartisan principles presented Monday by McCain, Schumer, Rubio, Durbin and Menendez.

“What heightens my concern is that we have history as a guide and history suggests this brand of so-called comprehensive immigration reform, this promise of enforcement as long as we have an amnesty, all those things put together is a recipe for failure,” Vitter said.

The sponsors have only agreed to a set of principles and still have to draft legislation, which will require hours of painstaking negotiation. The group hopes to draft a bill by March 1 and send it to the Judiciary Committee for hearings.
 
Schumer has discussed the group’s principles with Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who will be key to moving it through the panel.
 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who relied on a strong turnout of Hispanic voters to win tough re-election race in 2010, praised the framework and promised to play an active role in the debate.
 
“I applaud [the bipartisan group of eight] Senators for setting partisanship aside to tackle a crucial issue facing our nation. This is a positive first step,” he said. “I pledge that I will do everything in my power as Majority Leader to get a bill across the finish line.”
 
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) urged Reid to move immigration reform through the Judiciary Committee and not bring it straight to the floor.
 
“This effort is too important to be written in a back room and sent to the floor with a take-it-or-leave it approach,” he said.
 
Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) offered a less enthusiastic response than Reid. He said the House would review the Senate’s work but stopped short of calling for comprehensive immigration reform. 
 
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, panned the Senate proposal as amnesty and warned that it would encourage more illegal immigration.
 
But other past opponents of comprehensive immigration reform expressed a willingness to reconsider the issue.
 
Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, who voted against immigration reform bills in 2006 and 2007, praised his colleagues for trying to find a long-term solution.
 
“There’s a lot to be said for these members working together and moving the issue forward,” he said. “And, while I especially appreciate the group’s focus on legal avenues of immigration, there are a lot of questions to be answered on even the most mundane of topics.”
 
He expressed concern over the lack of detail for a proposed employment verification system.

Greedy banks of which we bailed out has been fined £390 million and i notice again the FSA getting money off the fine , What for , where are they when all these schemes are taking place , They are not preventing jack in the banking industry . They only seem to pop up when after years and years of the banks making dodgy deals and profiteering from them they say here we are and we finned them (most prob out of the money we gave). Shouldn't the FSA do there job and stop them in the first place as they should be looking after our interests as where is the money the customers been over charged ? we wont see that returned . The banking industry stinks with corruptness and every month there are more and more scandals and yet nothing is done , a new body should be brought in from the customers of the banks who lost money and the FSA scrapped as over the months its been seen as a wast of time and money Banks have started usurping the taxpayers cash , where does one go I thank you FirozaliA.Mulla DBA
==================================
One more time morons... this is only about votes...buying them for one party rule.

Remember.... a weaker America is the Liberal dream.

==================================

And even though this group of idiots are trying to create another amnesty program, the lying thug in OUR White House will undercut their so-called bi partisan effort by presenting his own "amnesty" program. He has NO intention of securing our southern borders.
I heard a Hispanic gentleman who stated the truth: the dems and republicans are using the Hispanic peoples as the "prize". And he was sick of it! He went on to state that his parents came to this country for a chance at a decent life and to extend that opportunity to their children. He stated neither he nor his fellow Hispanics should be use as a "prize" to any political party!
He was right!

==================================

The GOP has lost the support of most Americans. Only the old hard line folks, Wall Street, Big oil and the very rich are left. They are a dieing breed. Thank Goodness

==================================

That's it McCain - the hell with principle, start chasing demographics, Republicans should start prostituting themselves like the Democrats do, selling their souls for a chance to snare another group of voters. Whatever happened to rule of law? Amnesty rewards a group that has no respect for our laws or our traditions, a group whose only interest is to come to our country and get as much money as they can get. They have no respect for our institutions or our Constitution and if there was any sacrifice demanded of them, most would flee back to Mexico. You can give them amnesty, but they won't be Americans.

==================================

....the fence doesn't work???? Then take the fence down around the whitehouse.. it works that's why the stinking liberals don't want it.....it works around the tiajuana san Diego area....some cameras ,a .patrol road.the illegals pop up..send the jeeps with the weapons....what nonsensel.the fence don't work....a laraza.democrat lie....make the illegals build it..they cost us hundreds of billions of dollars...any cost is worth it.

==================================

The GOP believes that citizenship should be earned.
Liberal Dems want to give it away in exchange for a vote.
==================================

So . . . after alienating just about every minority group in America, suddenly the Party of NO wants to become "inclusive?" Talk about too little, too late!

==================================

McCain has been hanging around with Palin too much. Flip...flop...flip...flop.

==================================

Is this the same McLame that had the tv commercials about being all hard against illegals in the last election? The voters of AZ are idiots for voting this traitor back in office.

==================================

Marco Rubio, what is wrong with upholding the law and sending them all back so we who were born and legally here can breath for a change and move on with what is more important.
Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, you are ignorant to the needs of people who have done their share to make this county great. People lile you have only look to profit financially.

==================================

I am 57 year old and love the United States. Never did I think that we would hear from fools Like John McShame, Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio and others would not stand up to the treat of immigration from Mexicans crossing the border illegally.

If I have a right to shoot someone who illegally entered my home we should protect or borders in the same fashion and should have done so some 40 years ago in the interest of national security.

Do not believe the tear jerking stories you hear of why they come. It is all BS. They are no different from the roaches that would love to enter your home and find a place to live without worry.

These Republicans I have mentioned need to go. Rubio and Christy is a good place to start. Call them for what they are, politicians.

Why are our low-life politicians wasting welfare and food stamps on low-life illegal aliens??

==================================

The Washington times reported that in 2008 when the Columbian Free Trade Deal was sold to the USA Senate and Big VIPS in D.C. article was following the money it cost to by a Free Trade Deal from Senators...REPORTED MCCAIN STOPPED THE CAMPAIGN FLEW TO COLUMBIA AND PICKED UP A $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ CHECK.

THIS IS THE MAN.......WHO WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF OUR NATION? WHY IS HE NOT IN JAIL? FOR REAL. WHY IS HE NOT IN JAIL?

==================================

During the 2007 amnesty assault...John Mccain had a staffer..a registered fund raiser as are all of his staffer, I think..WHO TOOK A CHECK FOR A MILLION DOLLARS FROM VINCENTE FOX, PRESIDENT OF MEXICO. This was while the debate the fight was on.
When questioned..McCain said.."Vincente Fox has a constitutional right to give me money."
In the Senate..among the creeps standing around McCain..that is not even an ethics violation. The Tape of McCain defending the right of people to give to him for lobbyists to have all of the rights of private citizens...Check out You Tube.

==================================

Any immigration reform begins with sealing the border.
This debate will get ugly as Dems and the White House will do everything they can to dilute border enforcement. Dems want illegals to continue to cross into America unfettered.
==================================

SAME JOHN MCCAIN.. "Inside Job- The Looting of America's Savings and Loans Associations" NAMED JOHN MCCAIN "McCain was the most reprehensible" Phoeix New Times. IN THE 80's Free Traders, like Mccain , Freedman, Reagan, Kemp, took regulations off of S&L. For decades they had been safe retirement funds for Seniors..slow growth but safe. When the Regs were gone..LIKE in the Sub Prime Mess..the Looting began. Long story short.(Wikipedia has a good account) MCCain's Pal Charles Keating..looted a California SS for millions..maybe billions. WHEN GOVT REGS CAME AFTER HIM....MCCAIN WITH FOUR OTHER SENATORS CALLED THE REGULATORS IN..AND SCARED THEM OFF. MCCAIN QUOTE..." one of my jobs is to help constituents with a problem." and QUOTE>." I have done this sort of thing..many times.: THE SCARED GOVT. REGS. BACKED OFF.
then keating..persuaded old people in CA to take their GOOD certificates.and trade them for Worthless ones promishing them a Quick Buch. SMELLING THE MAMA OF SUB PRIME? THEY DID. THEY LOST EVERYTHING. MILLIONS OF SENIORS AND THE USA DID NOT DO BAIL OUTS THEN.NOR WERE THEY 911 FOR EVERY STORM.
IT COST THE USA 288 BILLION DOLLARS.
MCCAIN..NEVER WAS PUNISHED. KEATING WHEN TO JAIL. MCCAIN TOOK $112,000 FROM KEATING. HIS FAMILY AND BABYSITTERS WERE FREQUENT FLYERS ON KEATING'S PRIVATE JET..OFTEN TO HIS FABULOUS RESORT IN THE BAHAMAS..CAT'S CAY.

McCain was the most reprehensible of the Lot.

==================================

McCain: GFY

Enforce the laws we already have and ship the illegals right back across a secured border. Problems solved.

==================================

Yep, let's forgive them of their crimes and welcome them with open arms. That'll get them to to vote GOP alright.
==================================

Bi-partisan...LOL I see the underage sexman Bob Menendez (D-NJ) is part of the gang of eight. Read the bill there's probably a provison in there to get illegals hired in his office and not report them. Both NJ Senators are disgraceful...Lautenberg is pusing 92 yrs old and will keel over any minute. Good Grief...no wonder we have the legislation we have...sexist perverts and senile fools.

viva la raza supremacy???

HERE'S AN EXAMPLE... it's much worse than Mexico or the la raza dems will tell you.

The DREAM and the Nightmare

In California, students are better off being illegal immigrants than legal.

30 March 2012

Last year, Governor Jerry Brown signed the California DREAM Act, which makes students in the country illegally eligible for grants and waivers to attend one of the state’s public colleges or universities. The students must have attended school in the state for three years, “affirm that they are in the process of
applying to legalize their immigration status,” and show both financial need and academic achievement. Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, the Los Angeles Democrat who authored the DREAM Act, hails the legislation as a victory for those “in the
country through no fault of their own.” Opponents such as Republican assemblyman Tim Donnelly—a first-term legislator not given to understatement—called Cedillo’s legislation the “California Nightmare Act,” said it is “morally wrong,” and would create “a new entitlement that is going to cause tens of thousands of people to come here illegally from all over the world.”

==================================

It dosent make any difference how the party leaders feel or how president feels,the American people are as much aganist giveing their 11 million illegals citizenship as they ever were.These politicans are looking at the votes these people would give them .Our politicans are not even trying to hide their crooked tricks anymore.

==================================

The facts are that these are actions to appease the Mexican Cartels in hopes of keeping the peace in areas such as LA, southwestern Texas, and Arizona. The politicians benefit from the drug trade because the cartels line their pockets with payoffs (not to mention votes). The law enforcement is forced to engage in a live and let live peace treaty with the Cartels. The Cartels are told to keep providing the trust fund babies with good coke through intermediary channels and stay out of white neighborhoods. The payoffs are guns and police sponsored assistance against rival gangs. And of course, they all take their share of the profit.
Meanwhile, the Cartels are raping and killing thousands south of the border and are asserting greater control over LA and southern California territory. The Mexican Cartels are drug runners, nothing more, business people, more or less. But their political influence is not to be underestimated. Each time the Mexican Army destroys a cartel leader or boss this simply coalesces power into the hands of the surviving members making the survivors more powerful and able to exert even greater control over the political process.
This Immigration Bill and Gun Control measures are fraudulent, misleading, and distracting attempts to cover up the utter corruption in our government.

==================================

We need new republican leadership, not new immigration laws. Mexicans will NEVER vote republican. Never. Starting with Reagan, republicans preached immigration reform, amnesty, etc. if they allow this, Mexicans will vote democrat forever, destroying the two party system. Before ANYTHING is done with immigration, the border MUST be sealed. First. Then they can talk work programs, etc. this "reform" must NOT turn into a quick path to vote. Do you HEAR, Mr. Rubio?

==================================

What we now see is that the GOP is no different then the Democrats.. none of them enforced the last comprehensive immigration.. they just let them flow into America unchecked.. They don't give a damn what American's want.. they will do whatever they want as usual! I no longer trust my own party.. will someone in Washington grow some balz, expose the corruption and start a new party of real conservatives.. men and women with real principles, morals and values! Lord help us!

==================================

will Americans now wake up and form a Nationalist party or will they just fall like the Roman Empire?

==================================

    It is a shame that it has gotten so bad that we now must call for a nationalist party.
==================================

once again the politicians betray America.

==================================

...there's no fence,there's no security...,are they for real..????."..Before a pathway to citizenship can happen, the group says that new border security measures first must take effect, including an increase in the number of unmanned aerial vehicles and agents at the border, new rules tracking people entering the country on temporary visas and the creation of a commission of southwestern political and community leaders to ensure the new enforcement mechanisms take effect.".....they are going to hire more crooked .. probably mexican leftist politicians to insure the border is secure..REALLY?????.....but no fence?...same old bullsh*t.......open borders.playing tag with millions of foreign nationals........build a israeli style security fence...it's cheap..works against suicide bombers..terrorist and infiltrators into israel....BUILD THAT FENCE...stop lying to us....

==================================

    The fence is a joke. It is actually extremely expensive. We have some 2,000 miles of border with Mexico and all it takes really to get past a fence is a ladder. Border Patrol openly takes the stance that they would far rather have that money for more trucks and personnel than for the fence. The fence is one of those things that sitting at home watching tv it sounds like it makes sense, but in reality is ridiculous. Some parts of the border, the nearest border patrol agent might be 45 minutes away. It doesn't take 45 minutes to get over a fence.
==================================

Since neither president or Rubio are 'natural born U.S. Citizens', I doubt whether there will be any prohibition in either of their plans that would prevent the offspring of these undocumented aliens' born in this country from becoming 'citizens of the United States at birth', while their parents wait (10 years) to be naturalized. Once an offspring becomes a U.S. citizen by birth, the parents can then apply to be fast-tracked to U.S. citizenship. Therefore, let me supply an additional proposal:

All offspring born in this country, up to the time of naturalization of their parents, would not be considered U.S. citizens at birth, but must under go naturalization at the age of majority (i.e., voting age).

Secondly, reciprocity, must be a part of any immigration proposal adopted by Congress. Americans must be able to enjoy these same immigration requirement from the country of origin of any undocumented alien wishing to avail themselves of this country's generosity.

==================================

This amnesty bill is a complete ruse. The amnesty lobby is already scheming about how to thwart enforcement.

They will wave their magic wand of legalization/amnesty/guest worker visas immediately, while promising enforcement and border security that will NEVER materialize.

Past history is the best indication of the future, especially for our Congress and this administration.

For example:

**An entry-exit system to track foreign visitors has previously been mandated 6 TIMES previously by Congress, but never implemented.

**The 'commission' that will 'certify' that the border is secure will be composed of people who will not prioritize tough enforcement and won't stop people for gaining citizenship according to an amnesty proponent.

The open borders zealots, La Raza and ACLU are already saying they will fight any enforcement measures, including E-verify and employer sanctions.

We already had comprehensive immigration reform and it didn’t work.

    This amnesty will give citizenship to only 1.1 to 1.3 million illegal aliens. We will secure the borders henceforth. We will never again bring forward another amnesty bill like this.

    --Ted Kennedy on 1986 Amnesty

Comprehensive immigration reform won’t work now just as the debt ceiling does not work because it is nothing but political pandering and it won’t bring any more votes to Republicans just as pandering to black voters do not. Immigration has created a massive unemployable workforce that continues to be fueled by immigrant’s offspring.

It was the economy that lured them here and it will be the economy that forces them to leave if they are not given public entitlements for their vote.

Wake up you political fools.

==================================

    The landscape has NOT changed on immigration. As McCain says, it is his establishment GOP Washington insider cabal and GOP strategists for whom the landscape has changed, not the American people.

    This is a handful of GOPers, on their own, with no followers or troops, handing over the future of the nation.

    Immigration should be at a rate that matches how quickly new arrivals can be assimilated and self-supporting. That's better for immigrants, and better for Americans. But the amnesty these particular GOP leaders are acceding to puts the nail in the GOP coffin, and they probably know that.

==================================

Send them back to Mexico! No debate, no discussion, no compromise, just put them on a bus and send them back, shoot them on sight when they attempt to cross illegally. To reward illegals for their or their parent's criminality is ludicrous. Millions of native born Americans are out of work and our social welfare safety net is bursting at the seams. Show some compassion for those who are entitled to the benefits of citizenship based upon their or their parent's good citizenship and conformity with our laws. The browning of America's political landscape through mass infiltration is the most destructive social force to hit this country since prohibition.

The GOP obviously needs to reform itself, but the mollycoddling of illegals is national folly of the highest order. Republicans should ratchet up the quality of the intellectual debate, not capitulate to the opposition’s basest frivolities. Aliens are profoundly undermining our quality of life and the last thing needed is the legitimation of an ever-expanding hoard of unskilled, illiterate, drunks and drug dealers schooled in the ways of third world governance.

==================================

    Identify, find, apprehend, and bus 12 million people across the border. You ignorant simpleton.
==================================

        They didn't have any trouble walking across the border, and it wouldn't be much trouble busing most of them back. It's simply a matter of the will to do so. May seem draconian to you, but in the minds of many another the magnitude of the drain on our national resources represented by the presence of illegal aliens renders deportation an imminently cost effective solution. If they look Mexican then let them prove their citizenship. If they can't establish the legality of their presence then send them south on the first thing smoking. It wouldn't cost near as much as processing them through our criminal justice system and extending to them access to our social welfare safety net. Just the increase in highway safety would justify the effort.
 ==================================

            So now we should operate based on how someone looks? And, you wonder Republicans keep losing elections.
==================================

                Send them back to Mexico; no debate, no discussion, no delay!
 ==================================

REPUBLICAN PARTY: Look at the two states with the most hispanics, California and Nevada. Real big Republican based powerhouses alright? They are as blue as smurfs. You really believe you will get hispanics to the Republican Party through amnesty? Amnesty was already granted by Republicans and like I said, just look at California and Nevada.

You lost my donations, you lost my volunteering. When you fold as a Party, you can look back on this amnesty as the biggest reason why. There is no way you will make hispanics Republicans. I am a lifelong Republican and I hear hispanics everyday say how much they hate the Republican Party. Not only in 2012, but going back as far as my first year working the fundraisers for the GOP, 1990.

Center for Immigration Studies..IT IS ENDLESS ETERNAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

SEN. RUBIO..AND THE REST OF TREASON GANG OF EIGHT..WISH TO MAKE US RELIVE GROUND HOG DAY EVERY DAY..
EVERY DAY..UNDER THIS PLAN IS A NEW START FOR A NEW GROUP OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

FOR FUN..HOW ABOUT RE-OPENING THE FILE ON JOHN MCCAIN? FOR LOOTING THE SILVERADO SAVINGS AND LOAN..FOR MAKING MILLIONS OF SENIOR CITIZENS GO BUST..HIS PARTNER KEATING WENT TO JAIL...HE SOBBED LIKE A BABY IN THE SENATE BEGGED NOT TO GO TO JAIL..CITED HIS WAR RECORD..AND IT WAS A GET OUT OF PASS FREE.
IMHO...HE IS TRASH. DISHONEST TRASH. WHO IS HE TO TELL US TO ANYTHING? WE NEVER ROBBED OLD PEOPLE OF THEIR LIFE SAVINGS.

RUBIO..LOOKS LIKE A GROUND HOG.

“We reform the immigration laws, it puts 12 million people on the path to citizenship and eventually voters,” stated Eliseo Medina, international executive vice-president of Service Employees International Union, or SEIU.

“Can you imagine if we have, even the same ratio, two out of three? Can you imagine 8 million new voters who care about our issues and will be voting? We will be creating a governing coalition for the long term, not just for an election cycle.”

In 2004 Media was honored by the Democratic Socialist of America and made a DSA honorary chairman.

==================================

Being a current construction worker, (and former Paratrooper) I can tell you how many ways illegals work the system. I have seen it over and over again. A couple comes here illegally (usually several weeks pregnant),and the male takes a construction job that an American could be having. The female gives birth (at taxpayer expense) and immediately gets all kinds of benefits, (claiming to be a single mother) including EBT, welfare as well as state benefits.

Illegals lower the wage that Americans would get by undercutting their wage. They make the job site less safe because they cant speak English and dont understand basic safety procedures.

==================================

    Yeah great. You blame the person taking the job ???? Blame the employer more. Greedy employers are the problem. In the new age of stupid america, money rules, not principle. Wake up sarge, you should know better. Americans are their own worst enemies at times.
==================================

You really don't believe that do you John... if it is that easy for an illegal to change parties then they haven't a clue anyways.. and you GOP idjits are losing more than just the illegal vote.. you have evveryday American's who are fedup with the Republican Party.. but I would never vote Democratic.. I have more values, principals and morals than to drop down to the level of any Democrat.. what we need is another party.. of real men and women who will not be corrupted. Who have the will to run a country with God at their side. Right now most of them are working with the devil and I don't want any part of them! Also.. why are illegals able to vote anyways.. if their not an American citizen, they should not be able to vote..period!

==================================

Why are the Democrats focused on the 2nd Amendment and immigration reform? We have no federal budget, the economy is dragging and jobs are scarce. The priority should be to get Americans back to work and cutting the federal budget, before we spend more tax dollars and raise our deficits on illegal immigrants!

==================================

    They're doing it because they know that anytime they can get these RINO imbeciles to open their mouths the republican party loses votes.
 ==================================

    Its all about winning the next election. Thats all they care about
 ==================================

        Kind of like the Republican senate minority leader saying the "number one priority is making president a one term president". Read that again...the number one priority. Now, who is it that is only worried about elections??
 ==================================

Wait until the Messy-can illegal alien sees his first "Real" check, K- Juan, what's this CHIT "Fica" medicare, federal Tax, state tax, insurance premium, union-dues,AFLAC, WTF...OH, what a proud day, Welcome to America Sucker, I mean Juan.

==================================

What is wrong with our politicians, it use to be take care of the citizens of this country. Now it is take care of the illegals. The estimate is 400 billion between state and federal government but that is low it is probably closer to 800 billion that is every year folkes. They are illegals and 90% will be going on aid from welfare, food-stamps, section 8 housing, disability, and other government aid programs. Again 90% are receiving aid illegaly and we are broke. Why don't we institute Mexico's immigration bill; it says any one coming into Mexico to stay has to show they have the income to pay for living there, they have to provide proof of medical insurance. Again we are broke send them all back if they have received any aid except school. It is cheaper in the long run and if they want back in they have to pay the tax payers back all the funds that they had received when they were her illegally. What is needed is to get rid of all the politicians that are there now, all they have done is wrecked our great country. We cannot afford career politicians they are all crooked.

==================================

We need to focus on the economy and the federal budget instead of immigration and the 2nd Amendment. Where is the budget? Why is immigration reform the top priority when this economy is dragging and jobs are scarce?

==================================
Be still my beating heart! Could it be true?

Are Republican leaders daring to lead the Republican base rather than quivering in fear at them? Are the Limbaughs of the world marginalized? Is it just immigration or will GOP leaders lead the base on climate change, education, infrastructure, etc., also?

Has the crazy tail stopped wagging the rational dog?

Are responsible, worldly, thinking Republicans back in the driver's seat within their party? If so, Democrats could have real competition.

==================================

We sent those politicians to the Congress to work for US citizens, but they end up working for illegal aliens. Hey politicians, don't you understand you have to do what we want?

We do not need immigration reform. Over 1 million legal immigrants already enter the United States each year; legal immigration must be cut. The immigration system is not broken because over 1 million legal immigrants come here. The politicians are broken. They must not work for illegal aliens. They must work for US citizens only. We must not grant amnesty to those illegals who are here. Those individuals must be deported now because they do not obey laws. And the politicians who support amnesty for illegals, must not be reelected. Let's replace all the politicians who want amnesty for illegal aliens.

Let's replace all those politicians who want amnesty for the criminal illegal aliens.

==================================

    That's because the Knee-grows '97%',the messy-can '85%', and the Home-moe '99%' VOTE in BLOCKS. The puke Poli"TIC"ians know this. This is a science to them. The incumbent wins over 90% of the time anyway. Get it NOW. They are taking care of themselves, and all the rules are for US not them. Also remember, Socialism is Not for THEM, It's for YOU the useful Idiot.
    By the by, I don't mean you personally, but I know you know that.
==================================

The path to citizenship for the illegal aliens should lead directly back to their country of origin where they get in the back of the line and go through the established procedures in order to come here legally.

==================================

Republic or Empire ??? Sheeple ...... decide.

==================================
Republicans are hoping that by passing this immigration reform bill, they are hoping that come 2016, they will see a large shift to their side. Won't happen, these crackers don't have a compassionate bone in their body. Already some Republicans are against the bill, guarantee this is the tea party wing. Democrats will still get the majority of Hispanic votes.

==================================

    Oh course they will, the majority of Hispanics believe the government is there to take care of them and who better than the Dem's who believe in the collective to pander to their needs for their vote.
 ==================================

        Democrats have their vote. Who is really pandering for their vote at this point??
 ==================================

Republican politicians should not sell out the country for Hispanic votes. The Latino immigration activists only want more Mexican and Latin American immigration to increase their own political power, regardless of the consequences to the country.

==================================

The landscape didn't shift the Republican party caved like the cowards they are. Go ahead and pander but don't expect us to show up on election day voting for GOP candidates. You think eight million Republican voters sitting home last November was bad wait for the 2014 elections.

==================================

It irritates to constantly hear about Immigration reform hiding under the cover of Amnesty..It is dishonest, and Un-American.
President president did not need the so called Latino Vote..They needed a worth while candidate, Mr Romney was not fit to run
against a man that is amicable. While American's are drowning in
debt due to job losses, we idiot Legislators forcing our Government to violate the law, the Constitution and the respect
we have for Immigration laws, we have a fair system of Immigration the best in the world..We do not need for foreign
Government/s to criticize our values and fairness for our citizens.

The Republicans need NOT to make the mistakes President Reagan did in 1984..Awful!

==================================

Yeah, that'll work, John. Give 'em amnesty and watch them all just flock to the GOP.

Got another hunk of ocean-front property in your home state you want to sell us?

==================================

It better be a looooooong road to that citizenship.

==================================

    Ah,,,,, a Blue Texas,,,,,,, sweeet!
 ==================================

So it was really about the polls and pandering after all? I'm sure the teabaggers are going to rake these guys over the coals. ROTFLMAO!

==================================

    Will Brewer still be able to round them up?
==================================

Anyone who believes America is a democracy, not an oligarchy, better wake up !!! Sheeple.

==================================

McCain is a joke now and in the past, and always will be.

==================================

There are a lot of Hispanics who came here legally that do not like this. It may be more then the votes these stupid senators are trying to get. Like the democrats, they want an dependent class but they do not have any chance for this. The democrats own it all. IF anything it will endure that these people are throw out of power by their base or by the lack of financial support.

Jose Pescador Osuna, Mexican Consul General We are practicing
"La Reconquista" in California."

*
Lou Dobbs Tonight

Monday, February 11, 2008

In California, League of United Latin American Citizens has adopted a resolution to declare "California Del Norte" a sanctuary zone for immigrants. The declaration urges the
Mexican government to invoke its rights under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo "to seek third-nation neutral arbitration of ....disputes concerning immigration laws and their enforcement." We’ll have the story.

*
“One Mexican activist declared "bow down to the Mexican invasion or die.”

“Propaganda distributed as far south as Mexico City declares
"The United States is our enemy. Take back our lands at all costs." and advertise smuggling operations to gain access to Phoenix, Los Angeles, Dallas and other large metroplexes
where hispanics can blend in.”

PUBLISHED IN 2004. DO YOU THINK IT’S BETTER NOW? OR IN A STATE OF CRISIS?

These examples of illegal immigrant crime depict a growing menace to our functioning society. While a sleepy American public watches idly and a Congress refuses to enforce our
borders while mayors adopt the ‘sanctuary policy’, we citizens receive an average of 2,200 illegals every 24 hours, seven days a week, 365 days per year. Since the Amnesty policy was announced, the invasion intensifies with greater numbers.

==================================

    Its a scary world out there kid. Better just stay in your house.
 ==================================

Mine the borders. Approve lethal force for the border patrol.

Grant green cards to illegals who are here, after garnishing $10,000 from each, to offset costs.

No federal or state benefits for green card holders . Problem solved.

==================================

    Wouldn't it be funny if everything you think you know about illegal immigrants is based on a false narrative pushed by the GOP, FOX and Rush. A narrative created for the purpose of stoking the fear, hate and divisiveness between people like you and me.

    GOP made it's bed. Now they are laying in it with a bunch of angry voters like you, who feel betrayed and let down. On a positive note, maybe now they will be forced to come clean about immigrant workers. They work because they are hired by Americans. They work crappy jobs for extremely low wages. They aren't the enemy.
 ==================================

        The DEA Most Wanted, Immigration Human Cost, Victims of illegal Aliens, Ohio Jobs and Justice memorial says differently.
 ==================================

        Everything I know about illegal immigrants I learned by living on the border. What do you benefit by adding millions to the dependant welfare state?
 ==================================

    Sounds like the GOP is going the Amnesty Route
 ==================================

This is so funny , the GOP who has spent the last 4 years pushing their "self deportation " laws and policies but after being drilled by Latino voters at the polls last Nov, now want the Latino community to think they are their new Best Best Friend. I guess they they think Latino voters are as stupid as the Red State trailer trash !

==================================

    Why would you welcome illegals who do not respect our laws, many of which don't even speak our language, and will be added to welfare, food stamps, etc? How does it help the country?
 ==================================

        All I know work ,,,, and work hard,,,,,,,,pay taxing and SS they will never see,,,,. They are a greater help to country than the GOP!
 ==================================

            Pay taxes & SS, you are too funny. What crumbs they pay into SS hardly puts a dent in their cost. Forth Three Million scammed from the American taxpayer for refunds on unknown dependents living outside the US.
            Hard workers....right
 ==================================

            Only half I know work. There is the difference.
 ==================================

    Not only that, what remains of their constituency is in an uproar over their 'change of heart.' What their voters don't get is that this whole 'illegal immigrants are criminals taking your tax money' narrative that the GOP, Fox and Rush have been pushing for years, is nothing but a story created to cause fear, distrust and divisiveness.

    Who knows, maybe this will be enough to pop that alternative reality bubble they've been living in for so long.
 ==================================

        Seems like you follow your leader quite well. After all didn't he just say he could get more done if it wasn't for FOX and Limbaugh. Translation, the other news sources are already in the tank and will not report the real news.
 ==================================

        if you lived in a border state you wouldn't be calling it a narrative...
 ==================================

Of course we will have to secure our border? Right Congress.....is that why president is shutting down TARS on the southern border?

==================================

Latino Republicans are liken to the 1942's group, Jews for Hitler,,,,,

==================================

    u r an ahole
 ==================================

        Well,,,, when you have nothing to contribute to a discussion an debate, you can always resort to personal insults....
 ==================================

            u r my god
 ==================================

I guess since the new President of MX is in favor of the US granting amnesty to his citizens thereby making them eligible for every welfare program know which in turn allows them to send more remittances to MX, then American Citizens should just shut up, pony up and keep paying for their illegal existence.

RUBIO, the man who loves himself more than his people and his community, is still conflictëd amd making double-talk on "path to citizenship." My question we should all be asking him is: what path did his parents take to come to America, in the process jumping the queue ahead of so many million others because of the special treatment Cuban "refugees" received for generations, even still now?

ON EURO The United States and the European Union are
wrapping up final preparations for talks on a free-trade agreement that would
encompass half the world's economic output, Europe's trade chief said on
Saturday, while warning of "difficult negotiations." EU Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht will travel to Washington on February 5 to put the
finishing touches on a joint EU-US report. He gave his clearest signal yet that
Brussels and Washington are ready to embark on the
accord. "Essentially the report is ready. I will go to Washington to
discuss a couple of small items and for a final reading. But essentially we're
on the same page," De Gucht told Reuters in an interview in the Chilean
capital Santiago. "These will be difficult negotiations." A trade
deal between the world's two largest economies encompassing 800 million people
would unleash billions of dollars in transatlantic business, advocates
say. It could also allow Europe and the United States to define the rules
of global trade before China and India do. The 27-nation European Union
and the United States already account for nearly a third of world trade, but a banking
and debt crisis in Europe and meager American growth are pushing both sides to
consider removing the final barriers to trade. US companies have invested
some $1.9 trillion in production, distribution and other operations in the EU,
far more than in China. EU companies have invested about $1.6 trillion in the
United States. 'No low-hanging fruits' Given concerns about
getting caught up in endless negotiations, US President Barack president and EU
leaders called on an expert group co-chaired by EU Trade Commissioner Karel De
Gucht and US Trade Representative Ron Kirk to decide whether it was worth going
ahead. De Gucht said there was momentum for an agreement. "We
will have a common recommendation. If we were of the opinion that it was not
worth trying, we wouldn't have put in this much time," he said. A
deal could increase Europe's economic output by 65 billion euros a year,
equivalent to a 0.52 percent rise into the EU's gross domestic product,
according to the European Commission, benefiting industries from chemicals to
automakers. Both sides know negotiations will require
compromises. The United States and the European Union already have low
tariffs on their goods, but what businesses really want is access to each
others markets through common regulations. They would like to see a pact,
for example, in which a car tested for safety in the United States would not
have to be tested again in Europe, and a drug deemed safe by Brussels would not
have to be approved by the US government as well. "It's not about
low-hanging fruits or an early harvest," De Gucht said. "I have no
illusions that this will be easy." I thank you Firozali A.Mulla DBA

There seem to be a soft touch now by some
senators on immigration I see. IN USA Senators Offer a Bipartisan Blueprint for
Immigration? A bipartisan group of senators has agreed on a
set of principles for a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system,
including a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants
that would hinge on progress in securing the borders and ensuring that
foreigners leave the country when their visas expire. The senators were
able to reach a deal by incorporating the Democrats’ insistence on a single
comprehensive bill that would not deny eventual citizenship to illegal
immigrants, with Republican demands that strong border and interior enforcement
had to be clearly in place before Congress could consider legal status for
illegal immigrants. Their blueprint, unveiled on Monday, will allow them to
stake out their position one day before President president outlines his
immigration proposals in a speech on Tuesday in Las Vegas, in the opening moves
of what lawmakers expect will be a protracted and contentious debate in
Congress this year. Lawmakers said they were optimistic that the political mood
had changed since a similar effort collapsed in acrimony in 2010.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and one of the negotiators, said he
saw “a new appreciation” among Republicans of the need for an overhaul. “Look
at the last election,” Mr McCain said Sunday morning on ABC’s “This Week With
George Stephanopoulos.” “We are losing dramatically the Hispanic vote, which we
think should be ours.” The senator also said he had seen “significant
improvements” in border enforcement, although “we’ve still got a ways to go.”
He added, “We can’t go on forever with 11 million people living in this country
in the shadows in an illegal status.” According to a five-page draft of the
plan obtained by The New York Times on Sunday, the eight senators — including
Mr McCain; Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York; and Lindsey Graham,
Republican of South Carolina — have agreed to address the failings of the
immigration system in one comprehensive measure, rather than in smaller pieces,
and to offer a “tough, fair and practical road map” that would eventually lead
to a chance at citizenship for nearly all of the immigrants here illegally. The more sand that
has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through
it. -Jean-Paul Sartre, writer and philosopher (1905-1980) I thank you

These people are traitors plain and simple. They have betrayed the people in order to garner votes. They are doing everything possible to conceal the fact this is an amnesty. A reward for those who broke the law. Once the amnesty is established the other elements of the so-called "reform" will be abandoned. We don't need our immigration laws to be reformed. We already have good immigration laws. We need those laws to be strictly enforced.

president has defiled his oath to faithfully execute the duties of his office. He has not faithfully executed the law and has no authority at all to grant amnesty as he has done through executive order. The law is clear. All illegal aliens are subject to deportation. The fact an illegal alien does not have a criminal background or was brought here as a child does not exempt them from being subject to the law as president has decreed. president should be impeached for this malfeasance.

All illegal aliens should be returned to their country of origin and the country of origin should be charged for the expenses incurred by our government while they were here and for the repatriation.

The most I would support is green cards for highly skilled (masters or higher education) immigrants, and a guest worker program which only allows men without wives or children to come work in America.

==================================

    Why would you support that when we already have high skilled and low skilled American workers without jobs?
==================================

The Democrats are just importing more voters. That's all this is. Of course, Mexicans want more Mexicans in the US, duh. But, who do YOU work for?

==================================

pull out your Mexican flags...

here's a peek at our Mexican masters:

THANKFULLY, NO ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY HAS BEEN INFESTED WITH A FOREIGN POLITICAL PARTY
AS president’S HAS WITH THE MEXICAN FASCIST PARTY of LA RAZA!

HIS ADMIN IS INFESTED WITH LA RAZA SUPREMACIST!

DO A SEARCH AT THE BLOG FOR HILDA SOLIS, president’S SEC. of (illegal) LABOR, OR HIS AMBASSADOR TO MEX FASCIST, CECELIA MUNOZ, WHO IS FINANCED BY president WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS!

==================================

US citizens cannot afford to raise children in the manner they feel is appropriate so they slowed way down in having them. Immigration reform is now about creating citizens that will have children to provide for an aging population that is starting to retire. Conservatives will do what ever it takes now to keep from raising taxes on the wealthy.

==================================

    Nice try but the sole reason is "cheap" labor, it has nothing to do with an "aging" population. That is like saying we will allow these illegals to join the military at the same time president is gutting the military.
 ==================================

The GOP might just be beginning to figure out the reason they overwhelmingly lost among Latino-American voters last year. Hope that this bi-partisan measure gets through the senate!

==================================

    Seriously....the only reason they lost the so-called Hispanic vote is because most Hispanics will vote for whoever will give them the most handouts. Proof is in the fact most are Catholic but vote against the tenets of their faith and vote for a pro-abortion candidate.
==================================

CBS asks, “Is the US Constitution truly worthy of the reverence in which most Americans hold it?”

Why does it not surprise me that CBS would take this view of the foundation of our nation? This document is the bedrock upon which everything American was built. We are blessed to belong to the greatest country on the planet where individual liberties and freedoms were put ahead of any thoughts of autocratic rule after we won our battle for independence. It would have been ridiculously easy for some or any one of our founders to have decided that they could rule this new country in a fair and benevolent manner. Yet instead, ours was a revolution that obtained freedoms, not one that usurped them.

Now we have in our country, a movement that views the US Constitution as a flawed document because it limits the power of the federal government. That is why president despises it so much. He is on record saying as much, but this view didn’t start with him, we see it going as far back as Woodrow Wilson. His progressive views held little regard for the Constitution.

CBS has now given air time to yet another liberal whack job who also despises the Constitution.

Take a brief moment to view the video and then let’s let CBS know just what we think of their condoning the abandonment of our Constitution.

“The principal beneficiaries of our current immigration policy are affluent Americans who hire immigrants at substandard wages for low-end work. Harvard economist George Borjas estimates that American workers lose $190 billion annually in depressed
wages caused by the constant flooding of the labor market at the low-wage end.”

==================================

    OHHH NOOOO! Scary Mexicans!
==================================

Conservative morons: Remember that after the 1986 amnesty of 2.6 Million we had a period of prosperity and growth for 20 years. Something like 30 Million jobs were created and stock market tripled. Same thing will happen this year when we legalize 11 Million.

Remember, no legalization means no implementation of conservative agenda for many, many years.

==================================

    Another moronic statement by NRO. Are you like 20 yrs old? In 1986, there were more than 5 million jobs posted for hire that did not require a college degree. Today, there are 800,000 jobs available for hire that do not require a college degree. NRO, in case you did not know, there was a thing called NAFTA in 1993 that passed. Along with todays automation and outsourcing ( something not very present in 1986 NRO) the job market is not the same as it was in 1986 NRO. Another fact you might like to know. Sure, Reagan created 16 million new jobs and Clinton created 20 million, but since 2003, a negative 203,000 private sector jobs have been recorded. That is net gains versus net losses over the last decade. Because the tax laws changed in 2004 that many economists argued encouraged outsourcing of jobs overseas. That was not present in 1986 NRO. Go look up Corporations tax credits and outsourcing, foreign tax credits, or "Does USA tax laws encourage outsourcing of American jobs"? None of those were present in 1986. The job market has changed. No amnesty. It will make it worse today.
==================================

    The prosperity had nothing to do with giving over 3 million amnesty. Prior to amnesty interest rates were over 20%, when the rates went down under Reagan, that is when the economy gained traction
==================================

    Yeah, useful idiots would believe that amnesty for illegal aliens prompted prosperity and growth for 20 years.
==================================

    You think "amnesty" was the REASON WHY we have prosperity for 20-years????? Uh, I'm not sure you'd ever comprehend just how absolutely VOID of intelligence that comment is . . . you're definitely an obysmal voter.
==================================

    Yep so with 15 million or so, we will have prosperity for eons right. You might be right in one respect. We will be able to compete with other countries on the cost of our low skilled labor! It's already working. New manufacturing plants paying minimum wage are opening in Texas rather than messing with that whole wait in the customs line to come across the border with the goods.
==================================

It's an easy fix. Require a photo ID to vote and have a central check system to ensure that each person votes only once. They don't get to vote if they aren't legal...and then the pols aren't pandering to them as a voting bloc.

==================================

    Some States tried that and were threatened with law suits by Holder.
==================================

McCain says that the GOP is losing the support of the Latinos? I guess he forgot that in one of the primary debates Rick Perry was actually booed when he said that he allowed undocumented Texans to pay in-state tuition. The GOP lost the support of the Latino population some time ago and it's going to take more than one immigration bill to get it back.

==================================

    The reason behind that is the people of TX were by passed on that debate. They did not and still don't want illegals getting instate tuition while citizens from out of State have to pay out of State tuition.
==================================

here's the other reality on AMNESTY not by vote:

WHEN THE DEMOCRAT
PARTY IS NOT ADVANCING THE INTERESTS OF THEIR BANKSTER DONORS, THEY ARE WORKING
FOR DREAM ACTS, OPEN AND UNDEFENDED BORDERS WITH NARCOMEX, AND AMNESTY… OR
CONTINUED NON-ENFORCEMENT.

DID ILLEGALS REELECT president?

THEY REELECTED LA RAZA HARRY REID!

Mexico’s government has provided its nationals with valuable tools to help them cross he border safely but Dominguez is the first American resident, with a salary provided by U.S. taxpayers, to openly promote such a gadget. A few years ago
Mexican officials published a 32-page booklet (Guia Del Migrante Mexicano) with safety tips for border crossers and distributed hand-held satellite devices to ensure the violators complete their journey safely.”

BASIC FACTS ON McCAIN'S STATE of AZ:

1.) IT IS THE MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS GATEWAY TO THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST.

2.) IT IS ONLY SECOND TO MEXICO CITY FOR MEXICAN KIDNAPPING.

3.) IT IS THE CAPITAL OF MEXICAN HOME INVASION.

4.) IT IS THE CAPITAL OF MEXICAN CAR THEFT.

5.) PAYS OUT MILLIONS IN WELFARE TO ILLEGALS THAT NOT ONE LEGAL APPROVED OF BY

Since Mexican President Felipe Calderon started his crackdown on drug cartels and corrupt law enforcement two years ago, more than 4,000 people have been killed. The death toll among law enforcement has topped 500.
Kidnappings and violence are spreading across the border, and now the AP reports Mexican cartels have green-lighted hits against targets in the U.S. We’ll talk to Phoenix police about becoming the kidnapping capital of the nation and the rapid increase in other crimes linked to Mexico the city is coping with.

"I live in a Tucson neighborhood that is a major drug corridor. In the last four months there have been over 24 violent home invasions resulting in a number of deaths. It's harvest time now for marijuana in Mexico and Central America. We expect the
number of deaths to increase.

"One of the other tragedies is human trafficking. 'Coyotes' bring vans overfilled with illegal immigrants across the border, and because the load is more than the vehicle is designed for, the vehicle will often roll, or go off the road, killing the innocent people on board."

As a lifelong Republican, I hate to see my party fold, but that is what will happen in say 20 years after this amnesty. No more GOP. Hard to think about, but very true.

The immigrants will always give 70% of their votes to Democrats, who they identify with because they tax the rich and give to the needy. The GOP believes immigrants voted Democratic because of what their candidates said but you can go back 30 years and still find little immigrant voter support for the GOP. It is hard to believe the Republican Party believes that immigrants will become Republican overnight? Just look at the 1986 amnesty for 3 million illegals plus the many more millions they family petitioned. All research proves hardly none of those became Republicans. It was the Republicans that granted that amnesty and allowed those 3 million family unification. But In fact, no Republican candidate ever received a majority of immigrant votes since that 1986 amnesty.

Well Republican Party, let me know when the funeral is for your party. I'll send flowers.

==================================

    So you think the Hispanic vote went to the Democrats because they want to tax the rich? Did you come up with that yourself or did you get it from Fox News, Drudge or Limbaugh? Here's my take and I'm probably more qualified to speak on such a thing. I refuse to side with the likes of John Tanton, Russell Pearce, Kris Kobach, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Governor Jan Brewer. Keep in mind that I used to be a Republican.
==================================

Barry should be forced to UNSEAL records on FAST & FURIOUS before any vote on any immigration matter is considered.

To let BARRY get away with SEALING RECORDS on an issue that is tied to some possible immigrants, BARRY needs to COME CLEAN.

The increase for visas for foreign workers is the GOP's trick which allows companies to import "special skills" candidates to take high-paying jobs for less from our middle class, many of whom have the specifics skills. High Tech job loss to Indians and Asians from abroad are being fillied while Techical Schools and Universities continue to graduate these high skill Americans here. This wage suprresion scam needs to be taken out of the Bill.

==================================

    I suppose you are for a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans too.

    The reason the Indians and Asians are a problem to you is that they order their lives correctly. Debt and excess are not first on their list. They make less and do more with it and you want to penalize them.
==================================

Which party will be standing up for the actual citizens of this country? Bueller? Bueller?

==================================

    If you were born here then it would be the Democrats
==================================
    Really you think the government has a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers that fund the Treasury they plunder to stay in office? How 20th century.
==================================

    Why does it even matter?
==================================

So because both political parties need the Hispanic vote, the government has to take the tax money of hard working Americans, and give it to people that are here breaking the law.

Sure, that makes perfect sense.

==================================

    LOl if it was not so sad it would be funny, the problem is that it is only the dems that are benefiting from all this change the republicans are just giving them their taxes to do whatever they want.
==================================

    Who's this guy?

    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...
==================================

    The Republicans with the assistance of Fox and Rush are the ones who began perpetuating the myth of the illegal immigrant criminal taking your hard earned taxes. The reality is they are hired by American citizens to do scut work for cheap labor. Why don't they mention this? Because it doesn't fit the intent of the narrative.

    It's beneficial for them to keep you and me divided and fearful of each other because united we might just be able to see through all of their political games, both Republican and Democrats.

    Now the GOP has to back-track on the myth of the 'dirty, nasty illegals'. It will be interesting to watch them try to explain their 360 degree turnaround..
==================================

        That lil argument about taking taxes for for their healthcare etc.has been around for a lot longer then Rush or Fox have.. Ceasar Chavez and the farm workers Union 40 years ago fought against that argument, but it was true then and true now every time an illegal uses the ER...presidentscare to include millions more from amnesty, and medicaid patients for the poor won't help reduce ER visits either, the lines will get longer and more ER's will close....
==================================

        Isn't illegal criminal? Not much of a myth!
==================================

        What you call a "myth" is a ruinous reality in states with high illegal imigrant populations. And "dirty" and "nasty" are your words not ours. For us, just "illegal" is all there is to it. And we don't need to call them names or punish them. We just want them to go home. I'm sure many are really decent people. But they are here in violation of our laws and calling us names for wanting them to go home does make them any more welcome.
        As for Republicans changing their position on immigration reform ... If they change so that they are the same as Democrats, then they are not Republicans, no matter what they want to call themselves. Whether a Democrat calls themself a Democrat or a Republican they're still a Democrat. and I would never vote for a Democrat unless they were something else and just calling themself that ... and then i'd be hard pressed.
==================================

        Hey you nitwit, I live in Massachusetts which is the home of president's Auntie Zeituni and drunken Uncle Omar, both social services thieves...sorry if you don't like that reality.
==================================
            Ever heard of Donald Nixon or Neil Bush?
==================================

            How's Romneycare working for you?
==================================

                I have my own insurance, but for those who use it Romneycare is working well. Unlike Obocare it doesn't leave 20 million people uninsured, free to continue to bankrupt our emergency rooms...It caused 98% to be covered...a % that Obocare doesn't even come close to but when it is fully implemented less MA residents will be covered then before Obo the Clown got into the health field...Thanks for asking.
==================================

                    Well, I agree that presidentcare does not go far enough but remember that presidentcare uses
                    Romneycare as the framework and that has worked out in your state.
==================================
                        David you can spin it anyway you want but Romneycare was created without raising taxes, without reaching into the personal lives and financial histories of citizens and despite a democratic legislature that failed to complete the safeguards that would have kept it solvent, is still head and shoulders above Obocare, which was no where near ready for passage...but you know that...I'm just not sure you'd ever admit it...
==================================

    LOL. What ever happend to self deportation? 71% to 24% happend. Let's bring back Mitt Romney to lead the charge on immigration.

    The GOP sucks. They cave all the time. They can have the hispanic vote, but will lose the white vote. McCain is a RINO and the GOP has no guts. I plan to leave the republican party and become an independent.

        I left the GOP because they went far to the right. By today's standards Regan is also a Rino. president is more of a Regan Republican than today's GOP.

            No doubt you went to public schools...and there's no way you ever left anything...
==================================

                In private school, did they teach you that we little People were just resources for you to utilize? That would explain a lot.
==================================

                    They taught me I should take pride in my country...obviously you never had that course.
==================================

                LOL. Is that all you got? Not much of a counter argument. BTW, I recall someone saying that the GOP has to stop being the stupid party.
==================================

            That's okay I left the Republican party today over this announcement. I'll wait and see how many people like me vote third party from now on.
==================================

                I love it See Ya.........
==================================

                May I interest you in the Libertarian Party? We believe in the restoration of the Bill of Rights, the abolishment of the IRS, DHS, ATF and Federal Reserve Bank. No Neo-Con or neo-Marxist warmonger Democrat will do that for you.
==================================

                    Good luck with that..............LOL
==================================

                    That's exactly where I headed Nathan. Libertarians are not warmongers and are pro-choice which is a better fit for me anyway.
==================================

                Never thought that I'd read something like that from you but I have to respect the fact that you're sticking to your principles.

==================================

                        Nathan, please tell the class the US President that admitted to the world that he has a "hit list"...Here's a hint, he's tall, dark and narcissistic.

    The ones I know work way harder than almost any person I know. And they pay taxes.
    10
==================================

        Illegals pay taxes?
==================================

        The ones I have known in recent years are lazy as hell and belligerent in their anti-Americanism. One may typically expect to find them glued to their cellphones throughout the course of a shift. It is not uncommon to find several of them using the same SS#, they refuse to learn English, obey our laws, or assimilate. If they want to stay Mexican then I say by all means let them stay Mexican, send them back to Mexico. Moreover, they funnel billions of dollars back to Mexico for harvest by drug cartels and robber barons hostile to our country's national interests.
==================================

        They pay taxes? You mean they have false SS numbers?
==================================

            SS and medicare taxes,,, none of which they will ever get back .........
==================================

                47% of the illegals currently receive some sort of means tested support from our government.
==================================

                You mean like Barry Soetero

                president's non existent Colombia school ID

                http://www.snopes.com/politics...

                Whose SS # did they steal? And why don't you have a problem with that type of activity?
==================================
                    Hell I wouldn't mind having someone else paying into my SS...lolol...hopefully between the two of us I'll have a nicer lil monthly pile waitng :-) lol
==================================

                        You've got it wrong Lou, the thief will be entitled to half of yours.
==================================

        Yeah, and you probably employ illegals for your business cause your a cheap bastard who gains the system. That's what I would say to you if you did that, however I don't know that.
==================================

        Then they can follow the existing immigration process for citizenship. Why is doing so such a burden for them?
==================================

            Not a problem at all Its the fact if you apply here they send you away . Got it.
==================================

                Good, then they can get in line behind the people who respected our nation and are following our path to entry legally.
==================================

                How many should be accept per year? As many as want to come? Is that what you are advocating?
==================================

        Doesn't negate the fact that they have broken the law, disrespected our sovereignty, burdened our soclal services to the point that in many areas needly Americans are shortchanged and refused to assimilate. In doing so, they are dividing the nation and causing great animosity. The GOP is betraying its many supporters by concerning themselves more with votes than with what's best for the country.
==================================

            Well, they didn't get their traditional voters on November 6th 2012. Those grassroots GOP voters didn't even bother to go to the polls.

            So, they're turning to another group for votes. As unlikely as it is, they're tired of chasing the conservative mainstream voter who has opted out of the system, and has stopped voting.

            A 10% chance of getting an Hispanic is better than a 3% chance of getting a grassroots GOP voter.
==================================

            Moreover, their capitulation loses them as many votes as it gains. The need is for elevation of the intellectually debate.
==================================

            Shame on that political party concerning itself with what voting Americans think!
==================================

            GOP started this false narrative to manipulate the emotions of people like you and me. It is in their best interest to keep us divided and fearful of each other.

            It's no wonder you and much of their constituency is upset. They don't give a rat's ass about anything but getting another vote in their pocket.
==================================

                Despite what you've heard, insisting that our laws be enforced is in our best interest...I blame your teachers...
==================================

            And why are we worried about the frail feeling 's of republicans???
==================================
                I'm guessing Joe will starve to death when the producers stop producing and there's no more dole...
==================================

            Yeah, how did your ancestors get here?: destroying our laws, sovereignty, creating a far greater genocide that WWII, restoring Sovereignty with 152 Treaties and then violating each treaty. Nice. Will you like to be my pastor?
==================================

                Okay, so put them on the reservation, let then have what little land the Native Americans have left if you feel so sorry for them.
==================================

                You need to be a little more specific because there wasn't any one people native to north America and most of them were where they were because they'd pushed someone else out of the way.There were mean things done on both sides in that struggle. I don't blame today's Indians for some other Indians raping and murdering some of my ancestors and trying to kill a whole lot more. But the fact is, the Anglos didn't treat the Indians any better or worse than the Indians treated them ... they were just better at it.
==================================

                Frank, if you want to give your citizenship to someone who didn't show any respect to our nation, then have at it...Pack your bags and you can leave in the morning...despite what you've heard, these United States are not yours to give away.
==================================

                    My people have been here for 14,000years. You are the illegals. You turned paradise into an unflushed toilet.
==================================

                        I don't know...have you seen some of the neighborhoods and living conditions on some of the reservations? They don't look like the Chiefs and powers that be do a very good job of sharing the wealth amongst the majority from the Casino's earnings or the Federal dollars we throw at them...it's downright disgraceful the ones I've seen...why the percentage of alcoholics and low life spans? Your native occupiers haven't done much to further the living standards of your people much...it;s tragic,,,,kind of like our inner cities where we continue to throw money at the problem with very little results...
==================================

                        "Paradise" my ass, this country was possessed by hoards of murderous, superstitious, disease infested savages long before the advent of white society. Moreover, whites never murdered as many natives as the natives themselves. Perpetual warfare and even mass human sacrifice were the norm for hundreds of years before your people ever heard of the first Spaniard. Tell us, how did your people acquire the land from those who preceded them? The picture of the North American continent as a "paradise" prior to the arrival of Europeans is balderdash, who are you trying to kid?
==================================

                        Just pack your bags Frank...these United States aren't yours to give away.
==================================

                Classic. I don't see you volunteering to give your land/home/share of the spoils back. You're volunteering others' however.
==================================
                    They're real good at that.
==================================

                And don't foreget the Native America Holocaust
==================================

                    Part off the problem in the relationship between the various Indians and the Anglos was that early on the Seminoles tried to pul off a genocide against the Anglo settlers that left a real bad feeling of distrust. That was followed by alliances with the French and with the Confederacy that further exacerbated an already acrimonious situation.

                    To the Anglo's credit, they didn't try to exterminate or enslave all of the Indians. That is how many of the native cultures would have dealt with them, had they come out on top.
==================================

        Then let's have a points system as our "path to citizenship". Your friends get points for being self-sufficient. Those whose families require more in poverty abatement than they actually earn in income get to go home.
==================================

Sad portrait here. All these white senators and they have Rubio speak to the issue. Is he supposed to give it credibility and buy-in? Rubio has the least amount of seniority of anyone shown.

Where is the leadership here?

==================================

    It just proves the GOP has to be as phony as the Democrats to get elected.
==================================

        The GOP is phonier by far!!!
==================================

            The GOP is late to the "Being A Phony Party", but they are catching up quick.
==================================

                You 'Silly Rabbit' the GOP set the standard!
==================================

                Ah! Your name explains a lot.

                But if you really want to know the Republican Party read the book "Deer Hunting with Jesus

==================================

        Good observation on your part Josh. We know you cannot be all things to all people. You either stand for something or fall for anything.

        When they write the book on the decline and fall of the American Empire, right after a chapter on strangling debt will be a chapter on how she compromised on everything. Eventually she stood for nothing.
==================================

            What's really sad is how a country that was not so long ago about American's work ethic, about American greatness, about American's working to be the best, has now become a country of two political parties competing to see how fast each can take the wealth from those who produce it, and give it to those who do not.

            And even sadder, now there is a majority of people in the country that accept this vision.
==================================

                Unlike most of the individuals who come here and post. 95% of the voting electorate are ill informed and the products of media sound bites.

                They mean well, but if told there is only a donkey and an elephant to chose from, they will chose from those two options. Not realizing one is no better than the other.

                Our $16 trillion pillaging, shearing of the sheep is truly a bi-partisan effort if ever there was one.

                Yet leaders from both party's will get on C-Span and act like deer caught up in the headlights of an on-coming vehicle.
==================================

            It would have looked bad to have Senator Bob "I rape young Latino children" Menendez promote a bill to bring in more young Latino children.
==================================

Senator, McCain, sworn to uphold the US constitution, please read, become familiar with it...

We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more
perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to OURSELVES and OUR Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

Section 4

The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.

Section 8

4: To establish an UNIFORM Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the
United States;

[Article XI]

The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.

+++++++++++++

The power of Congress “to exclude aliens from the United States and to prescribe the terms and conditions on
which they come in” is absolute, being an attribute of the United States As a sovereign nation, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy. Jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of every independent nation. It is a part of its independence. If it could not exclude aliens, it would be to that extent subject to the control of another power. *** The united States,
in their relation to foreign countries and their subjects or citizens are one nation, invested with powers which belong to independent nations, the exercise of which can be invoked for the maintenance of its absolute independence and
security throughout its entire territory. --- SCOTUS 1889

“If Congress can forbid the entry
***, it can punish those who cooperate in their fraudulent entry.” --- SCOTUS 1909

++++++++++++++++

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

==================================

    Even ole Glenn Beck said he would vote for Hillary Clinton over John McCain.
==================================

        NEITHER ONE!
==================================

        The Problem for Republicans is not that the Mexicans hate them, it is that every body hates them.
==================================

            You certainly have a way with words, Nathan. I'll bet you think that is cleaver don't you.
==================================

                cleaver = clever
==================================

                I'm sorry, that was not fair. The Weapons manufactures, investors and bankers really love the Republicans. the other 98% of Americans do not like them very much, as we are their victims.
==================================

                    Nathan, please list the banksters that Obo the Clown has put in jail...
==================================

                        Actually, he just approved via his so-called TARP administrators, a nice hefty bonus/raise package for those same ceo's.
==================================

                    Rumor has it the last election was about 47:51. But sure let's go with 98%. Math is not your strength is it? Fortunately you live in a country who believes self-esteem is of more value than actual skills, so you'll be fine.
==================================

                        Actually when a republican sits down and learns the truth they wholeheartedly support the Democrats, it is only those that blindly follow their leaders and do not question them when their actions are the opposite to their words that support the republican party which is only republican in name now, they are more the fascist party and the Nazi party now , people who believe so strongly that their voice is the only voice and that cannot admit tell the truth even to themselves.
==================================

==================================

                        I am a gay Republican who love president.

                        Everything is GWB's fault.

                        F$%# the GOP!
==================================

    That's a nice document your quoting from, history has shown on this issue and others, that it's not worth the paper it's printed on. If it was, everyone in Congress would be facing treason charges for spending the country $16 trillion in debt.
==================================

For dumb Republicans: If Republicans block Comprehensive Immigration Reform again then there will be no Republican Presidency in 2016 or 2020. Kapisch!

==================================

    president voted against immigration reform in 2006 when GWB proposed a nearly identical bill. Your hero is a wolf in sheeps clothing. Guest programs hurt unions, he was against it for this very reason. He is going to try and torpedo this legislation by removing the compromise of border enforcement. He can then use the GOP as a scapegoat even though it is him and unions that truly hate the guest worker programs put forth in the bill.
==================================

    How many immigrants would you allow legally each year? What is wrong with the numbers we accept now? Do you have an actual position on immigration?
==================================

    See how NRO ended the sentence with a non English word for undersatnd? They hate the English language and next they will want it abolished.
==================================

        COME TO MEXIFORNIA! look around you.. you will find it hard to hear English ANYWHERE!
        MEXICANOCCUPATION.blogspot.com
==================================

    Isn't that sad? People that are here illegally, who want to jump the line of those going through the legal immigration process, have a gun to the head of the American people to make the government to do what they want. And what's stunning is our politicians can't bend over fast enough or far enough to meet their demands.

    I guess that's fine, until the welfare money runs out.
==================================

    That would be an accurate statement. The demographics have the Latinos in the lead with the numbers to achieve victory.
==================================

        and Mexicans breed like bunnies!
        THEIR BIRTH RATES ARE DOUBLE THAT OF LEGALS.... but we still get the ANCHOR BABY = 18 YEARS OF WELFARE TAX BILLS!

        in la raza-occupied los angeles county that tab is $600 million per year. source JUDICIAL WATCH.

        MEXICANOCCUPATION.blogspot.com
==================================

            No one in either party will admit or allude to this, but the American people were sold out on this one.

            Every year the American public gets/accepts a larger in diameter shaft by way of reduced service and higher taxes to provide yet more school, health care and criminal justice services.

            Our veteran career politicians will posture and act like deer caught in the headlights and are now considering a band-aid solution for their oversight.
==================================

    F U
==================================

        And F U through & through
==================================

        Hilarious how TheHill is attempting to create this fiction that "the landscape has shifted!" We've seen this before: Elitists from both parties come together in an attempt to shove mass lawlessness down the throats of American taxpayers.

        But WE haven't changed. We still don't want it. Until our immigration laws are enforced, and illegals realize it's best to return home, an amnesty is OUT OF THE QUESTION.
